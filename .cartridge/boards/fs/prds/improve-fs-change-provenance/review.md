# Share change attribution between direct files and overlays — review

Canonical PRD: [@fs/improve-fs-change-provenance](prd.md). Reviewer: `/root` (self-review).
Round limit: 5. Agent threshold: 90/100. No user score was supplied or invented.

## Round 1 — inherited, 2026-09-13

- [improve-fs-change-provenance](../../../root/reviews/round-1/improve-fs-change-provenance.md): reviewer 90/100; Keep. Explicitly distinguishes observation from overlay ownership; reuse a sessions-owned schema and test legacy records.
  Original SHA-256: `96495702186e03ce3cd465835fb0038a866f2845e3fe17c536fb34be5491dc5c`.

Historical dimension scores were not recorded. The original user-rating field was pending; the current workflow delegates scoring to the agent. Splitting does not reset the allowance.

## Round 2 — 2026-09-13

Revision: the working-tree PRD and the exact input digests in [review-inputs.json](review-inputs.json).
Change: small owner-local contract; broad parents point to leaves, and canonical aliases share one implementation scope.

| Dimension | /20 | Evidence and deduction |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Value and scope | 19 | The PRD states its bounded outcome; inherited broader requirements are retained in source history and linked children. |
| Ownership and reuse | 19 | Named cartridge and existing starting files; historical duplicate IDs are mapped to this canonical scope. |
| Dependencies and slices | 19 | Qualified hard dependencies resolve; the complete parent/child graph is acyclic. |
| Acceptance and baseline | 18 | Unchecked behavioral acceptance and a real repository gate; fixture details and measured baselines must be captured before specs. |
| Failure and compatibility | 19 | Negative outcomes and a recovery boundary are retained; implementation must supply the specified failure proof. |

Agent score: **94/100 — PASS**.
Finding: One bounded outcome with explicit positive/negative checks. Fixture-specific specs and baseline measurements remain analysis work; proposed tests are not reported as passed.
Blocking review findings: none; implementation prerequisites remain in the PRD.
Validation: complete work-map coverage, content digests, local links, short-leaf bounds and dependency-cycle checks; see [validation record](../../../root/reviews/validation.md). Product gates were not run.
Rounds used: 2/5; remaining: 3. User feedback: create small defined PRDs and split broad work.
Next: select a dependency-ready leaf, probe its contract and write specs before implementation.

## Round 3 — 2026-09-13

Independent reviewer /root; proposal author /root/proxy_continuation. [Exact inputs](review-round-3-inputs.json).

| Dimension | /20 | Evidence and deduction |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Value and scope | 19 | Original attribution/divergence acceptance retained as integration rollup. |
| Ownership and reuse | 20 | Separate owner leaves; parent adds no implementation. |
| Dependencies and slices | 19 | Direct and transitive dependency receipts required; executable binding remains deferred. |
| Acceptance and baseline | 18 | Measured native baseline and real composed fixture; no completed-product claim before child proofs. |
| Failure and compatibility | 19 | Observed identity only, optional recording, partial outcomes and legacy behavior are explicit. |

Agent score: **95/100 — PASS**. No blocking plan findings. Product tests remain required. Rounds used 3/5; parent executable receipt binding is deferred until children collect.
