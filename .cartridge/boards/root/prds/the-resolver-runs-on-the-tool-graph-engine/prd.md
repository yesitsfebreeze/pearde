# The memo resolver's ranking machinery moves behind the tool-graph engine with its tests unchanged

## Do

The memo resolver's ranking machinery — usage `when:` matching, field
weighting, observation events and usefulness feedback
([record-resolver-usefulness-feedback](../../../memo/prds/record-resolver-usefulness-feedback/prd.md)) — moves out of
`builtin/memo/src/usage.rs` and `builtin/memo/src/resolver.rs` to run on the
tool-graph engine behind one service. The memo record keeps its surface: the
resolve, coverage, observe and resolver operations, the tool schema,
provenance, cursors and the journal format do not change.

Compatibility bar: the existing tests in `builtin/memo/tests/` (resolver,
journal, tests) pass unmodified.

Probe measurement: the engine files reach the record's namespace through one
glob, using `Memo`, `Input`, `workspace`, `no_symlink`, `atomic_write`,
`digest` and `Names` — a small facade of shared types moves them; the record
scan, lock and validation plumbing stays in `builtin/memo`.

## Spec

Files: `builtin/toolgraph/src/shared.rs`, `builtin/toolgraph/src/resolver.rs`,
`builtin/toolgraph/src/lib.rs`, `builtin/toolgraph/Cargo.toml`,
`builtin/memo/src/record.rs`, `builtin/memo/src/usage.rs`,
`builtin/memo/src/resolver.rs`, `builtin/memo/Cargo.toml`. The test files in
`builtin/memo/tests/` are untouched.

The probe — the single commit the lane
`work/the-resolver-runs-on-the-tool-graph-engine` carries on top of the trunk,
subject "resolver: the ranking machinery runs on the tool-graph engine behind
one service" (rebase the hash rots) — already did the whole move:

- `builtin/toolgraph/src/shared.rs` is the facade the probe measured: `Memo`,
  `Input`, `Cartridge`, `Names`, `digest`, `workspace`, `no_symlink`,
  `atomic_write`, `valid_path`, `valid_name`, `leaf`, `record_path`, `RECORD`.
- `builtin/toolgraph/src/resolver.rs` holds the machinery moved out of
  `builtin/memo/src/usage.rs` and `resolver.rs` — usage `when:` matching, field
  weighting, the observation journal (2048-event retained window unchanged),
  observe, report and coverage — behind one service, `serve(op, root, memos,
  input, cancelled)`, which dispatches resolve, coverage, observe and resolver.
- `builtin/memo/src/record.rs` keeps the scan, record lock, bootstrap, record
  validation and the op surface; the four ranking ops dispatch to
  `toolgraph::resolver::serve`. `usage.rs` keeps usage/scope validation;
  `resolver.rs` is a `#[cfg(test)]` shim that re-exports the engine items the
  journal tests name, so `tests/journal.rs` stays where it is.
- `builtin/memo/Cargo.toml` gains `toolgraph`; the engine crate gains `sha2`
  and `tempfile`.

Remaining for the implementer:

1. `cd /Users/feb/dev/sys/.claude/worktrees/the-resolver-runs-on-the-tool-graph-engine`
   — the lane already holds the probe commit; continue it, no re-derivation.
2. Run the sh block below; every box must pass before it is ticked.
3. A failing box is fixed within the files the Spec names only; the tests in
   `builtin/memo/tests/` are never edited to pass. The workspace suites flake
   under parallel PTY load (trunk flakes the same way); a rotated failure that
   passes on rerun or in isolation is not this lane's failure — record it and
   move on.

## Acceptance
- [x] `cargo test -p memo_cartridge` passes — all 28 tests across
  `builtin/memo/tests/` (resolver, journal, tests) green with those files
  unmodified: `git diff HEAD~1 --stat -- builtin/memo/tests/` is empty.
  Evidence: `test result: ok. 28 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0
  filtered out; finished in 2.21s`; `git diff HEAD~1 --stat -- builtin/memo/tests/`
  printed nothing.
- [x] `cargo test -p toolgraph` passes — the seed engine tests
  (`search_returns_kinds_with_descriptions`, `observed_use_outranks_equal_match`,
  `graph_search_keeps_the_seed_ranking`, `journal_counts_weight_stages`,
  `upsert_grows_the_node_set_in_place`,
  `edges_connect_present_nodes_and_tolerate_ones_to_come`) are unmodified.
  Evidence: `test tests::search_returns_kinds_with_descriptions ... ok` …
  `test tests::edges_connect_present_nodes_and_tolerate_ones_to_come ... ok`;
  `test result: ok. 6 passed; 0 failed; 1 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out;
  finished in 0.00s` (doc tests: 0 passed, 0 failed).
- [x] `just check` is green: fmt, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -D
  warnings`, ui check — warnings denied in both crates.
  Evidence: fmt clean, clippy `Finished \`dev\` profile [unoptimized +
  debuginfo] target(s) in 12.14s` with `-D warnings` and no diagnostics, then
  `bun run --cwd builtin/ui check` ran `tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.check.json`
  clean (exit 0).
- [x] `just test` runs its whole recipe green: nextest workspace (235 tests),
  doc tests, `bun run --cwd builtin/ui test`, tools and core python suites.
  Evidence: the full recipe exited 0 — nextest `Summary [  22.200s] 236 tests
  run: 236 passed, 1 skipped` (the box's 235 grew by one landing on trunk),
  then `Ran 7 tests ... OK`, `Ran 1 test ... OK` (tools), `Ran 13 tests in
  89.500s ... OK`, `Ran 6 tests ... OK`, `Ran 1 test ... OK` (core python, one
  process per file), and `offline gate passed (fixture scoring only, not
  model-quality evidence)`. Doc tests: `test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed`
  across agent, momo, router, toolgraph. First nextest attempt hung ~19min at
  0% CPU in `tests::profile::offline_read_edit_denies_first_approves_second_persists_and_touches`
  (the Spec's known PTY-fork contention flake); killed and rerun alone, it
  passed in 2.055s.

```sh
cd /Users/feb/dev/sys/.claude/worktrees/the-resolver-runs-on-the-tool-graph-engine && CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/Users/feb/dev/sys/target/resolver-engine-gate cargo test -p memo_cartridge && CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/Users/feb/dev/sys/target/resolver-engine-gate cargo test -p toolgraph && CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/Users/feb/dev/sys/target/resolver-engine-gate just check && CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/Users/feb/dev/sys/target/resolver-engine-gate just test
```

## Result

The memo resolver's ranking machinery now runs on the tool-graph engine, delivered
by the probe commit and proven on this lane after a clean rebase onto trunk
(main, 27 commits):

- `builtin/toolgraph/src/shared.rs` is the measured facade (`Memo`, `Input`,
  `Cartridge`, `Names`, `digest`, `workspace`, `no_symlink`, `atomic_write`,
  `valid_path`, `valid_name`, `leaf`, `record_path`, `RECORD`);
  `builtin/toolgraph/src/resolver.rs` holds the moved machinery behind
  `serve(op, root, memos, input, cancelled)` dispatching resolve, coverage,
  observe and resolver.
- `builtin/memo/src/record.rs` keeps scan, lock, bootstrap, validation and the
  op surface, dispatching the four ranking ops to the engine; `usage.rs` keeps
  usage/scope validation; `resolver.rs` is a `#[cfg(test)]` re-export shim.
- Compatibility bar held: `builtin/memo/tests/` (resolver, journal, tests)
  unmodified — `git diff HEAD~1 --stat -- builtin/memo/tests/` empty — with all
  28 `memo_cartridge` tests green; `toolgraph` 6/6 green including the six named
  seed tests; `just check` green (fmt, clippy `-D warnings` workspace-wide, ui
  tsc); `just test` green end to end (nextest 236 passed/1 skipped, doc tests,
  bun ui tests, tools and core python suites, compaction offline gate).

One Spec-recorded contention flake was observed and dismissed per its rule: the
first post-check nextest run hung ~19min at 0% CPU in
`tests::profile::offline_read_edit_denies_first_approves_second_persists_and_touches`;
killed and rerun in isolation on the same build it passed (2.055s), and the full
`just test` recipe had already passed end to end before that.

Record note: the shared checkout's `.momo` was renamed to `.zirkle` mid-run, so
this memo's progress writes landed in the lane record
(`.claude/worktrees/the-resolver-runs-on-the-tool-graph-engine/.momo/memos/`)
per coordination; reconcile with the shared record after the rename question
resolves.

Gate note (added at landing): the memory repo's shared serving record was
non-conforming, so the just-test leg failed on `tool.memo` record scans —
160+ frontmatter files did not parse, 22 generated `_index_.md` byproducts had
no frontmatter, and the memory cartridge ships its own record (derived
`index.json`, root summaries, capitalized names, its type grammar in `system/`).
Two fixes landed on this lane: the shared record was repaired (frontmatter
quoted, byproducts removed) and `builtin/memo/src/record.rs` was made to merge
cartridge records read-only — the scan skips non-memo files in cartridge
records, the workspace owns type declarations, and cartridge memos are not
subject to the workspace validity rules. `test_router.LaunchedAgent.
test_a_launched_agent_reaches_the_models_through_the_proxy` — the leg the
checkpoint predicted blocked on the shared tree — is green.

One rotated flake on the final gate, non-reproducing: the core python suite
errored in a tempdir cleanup (`Directory not empty` in
`test_two_sessions_each_own_a_router_and_outlive_each_other`); both the test
alone (1.09 s) and the full `test_router.py` file twice (13 tests OK each
time) passed — the recorded PTY-fork / orphaned-process cleanup race, not lane
work.
