# the-board-log-replays-who-did-what

## Outcome

A swarm's work is followable after the fact. Every event that matters — a post, a
run started and finished, a tool called and its outcome, a session spawned, a
wake — lands on one ordered log carrying the session, the parent, the run and the
call it belongs to. `follow` renders that log as a readable sequence: who did
what, in which channel, in what order, and what it cost. Filtering by session,
by channel or by run answers "what was this agent doing" without reading a
transcript.

The log is telemetry, not a second record: it says what happened, while the memo
record says what is true.

## Check

- [ ] A recorded two-agent task replays through `follow` as an ordered sequence
      naming each actor, its parent, its run and its channel, with no event
      unattributed.
- [ ] `follow{session}` and `follow{channel}` return subsets of the same ordering,
      and a `run` filter returns exactly that run's events.
- [ ] A tool call appears with its outcome and duration, and a failed call is
      distinguishable from a cancelled one.
- [ ] Events survive restart and keep their order across it.
- [ ] A wake caused by a post names the post that caused it, so a reader can
      follow cause to effect across two sessions.
- [ ] The log is bounded: past its configured size it rotates without losing the
      ordering of what remains, and `follow` says what was dropped.
- [ ] `just check` and `just test` pass.

## Approach

Observed 2026-09-12. The pieces exist separately: sessions already records
lifecycle events and takes `message`, `run_started`, `tool_started` and
`tool_finished` records (`builtin/sessions/main.rs:171`), the harness appends a
run's telemetry block to the prompt, and `zirkle debug` mirrors every host socket
message to `.zirkle/logs/debug.log` as JSON lines. What is missing is one
ordering across sessions and a projection over it. The identity to thread is
already decided by [[@prd/work/root--a-turn-carries-one-id-through-host-lua-and-bun.md]]; this is
that id used as the join key rather than a new one.

## Spec

One append-only event file beside the channels, in the same store, with the same
per-append sequence discipline as a channel line — so a post and the run it woke
are orderable against each other without clock comparison. An event is
`{seq, ts, session, parent?, run?, call?, channel?, kind, name?, outcome?, ms?}`
and nothing more: no payloads, no arguments, no output. The story is who and
what, and references point at the rest, exactly as
[[@prd/work/root--a-board-message-is-a-reference-not-a-payload.md]] requires for messages.

`follow` is a read projection with filters and a limit, and its default output is
one line per event, indented by parent, so a swarm's shape shows in the log's
left edge. It is the thing a person reads when the swarm went wrong, so it is
plain text by default and structured on request.

Rotation is by size with the sequence preserved: the log is for following recent
work, not for auditing forever, and an unbounded log in a store that loads into
memory is a slow leak.
