# Index

| write | means | resolves to |
|---|---|---|
| `@<path>` | **one file** — the real path from the repo root with `@` in front | itself. Nothing to look up |
| `@@<keyword>` | **one scope** — everything you must read to understand a feature | its row in [Keywords](#keywords) |

`@@` names a row in this index, not a path on disk. No keyword is a directory.

Board paths (`.pearde/…`) are neither. They address a board, not this skill.

**A scope is what a feature is made of, not a reading list.** Read the one
file that answers the question in front of you — the first anchor in a row is
that file, and the rest are what it sends you to. A pass that opens a whole
scope pays for the manual again after every compaction, and pays for it in the
window it needs for the work.

**Where a file goes.** Markdown that someone reads lives under `references/`.
Anything executed — a script, a tool, its config and its data — lives under
`resources/`, whole. A tool's own README ships inside the tool.

**Every skill is one file under `skills/`** — frontmatter that decides when
it fires, and a body that points into `references/` and stops. The knowledge
is never in the skill. What a skill *runs* lives under `resources/`, one
folder per skill where there is one: @resources/board/, @resources/scout/ and
@resources/graph/. `.pearde/wiki/` is data the tools read and write —
gitignored, not source, and its own Obsidian vault.

Installing turns each file into a folder of links elsewhere. Nothing in this
repo moves. @references/install.md is the whole of it, and it names no agent
— which directory to build in is the reader's to work out.

**Every tracked file has a row in @references/files.md** — the manifest, split
off so this map stays the size of the question it answers. When a file moves or
is added, write its row there, then every [Keywords](#keywords) row whose scope
it changed. Nothing else points at it.

@resources/index.py reads both and is the only reader of either format.

## Keywords

A file appears in every scope it belongs to. The first anchor in a row
explains the rest.

## Files

@references/files.md — every tracked file, one row. It is read when a file is
added or moved, and by @resources/index.py; never to answer a question about
the work.
