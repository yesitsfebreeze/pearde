# a-parked-child-holds-the-parent — two readers of one rule, disagreeing on the same second

## Decision

The gate's reading won: a parked child holds its parent. Both readers call
one function, `plan.dispatchable` in `plan.py` — `scan`'s ready band,
`plan`'s frontier and `claim`'s gate — so they cannot disagree again. The
same function refuses a container (`container:` — children every one `done`,
no specs and no open box of its own), so `claim` cannot trap one at
`analyzing`; a container is `collect`'s. The held parent is listed under
`gated` with `held by <child> (parked)` — visible, never offered. Found by
the master-board session on 2026-08-28: `scan` listed `@mitosys/p6-rust-core`
as `ready`, and `claim @mitosys/p6-rust-core <w>` refused with `leaf: has
children not done — p6n-chat-tui`, a child in a parked, user-owned state.

## Why

@references/parts/board.md: a parent with children is not dispatchable until
every child is `done`. @references/parts/states.md: a parked state is the
user's own, never dispatched, out of every count. The two sentences never
said what a parked child means for its parent, so the two readers guessed
differently. A parked child is neither done nor coming; the parent cannot
land after it, which is what `order.md`'s "a parent lands after its children"
makes of it — so the gate's reading is the stricter and the right one, and
`scan` should stop offering the parent. The cost of the other reading is a
round that dispatches a parent whose child the user set aside.

## Alternatives considered

**Scan is right, the gate is loose.** A parked child would then be treated
as done for the parent's sake. Rejected on `order.md`: work flows to the
leaves, and a leaf the user parked is a leaf the board has been told not to
finish — so the parent is not finishable either, and offering it invites a
worker at a tree the user has paused.

**Both readers call one function.** The fix whichever reading wins:
`gate_claim` and the ready test share one predicate in `plan.py`, so they
cannot disagree again. That is the shape the fix takes; the memo is open on
which reading, not on the shape.

## Consequences

- Until settled, `scan`'s ready band can offer a parent that `claim` refuses;
  the refusal names the child, so nothing is dispatched wrongly — a round
  loses one call, not a worker.
- Two verify-block spellings fail at collect though they pass for a worker:
  `grep -c … # 0` (grep exits 1 on the wanted zero) and `grep …; test $? -eq
  1` (under `set -e` the grep aborts first). `! grep -q …` is the spelling
  that works — the library already carries the first as a `## Fails when`
  row; the brief header is the other place for it.
