# adjacent-edits-merge-into-one-hunk — a hunk with two authors has no baseline to match

## Decision

Decided 2026-08-29, built in `collect-keeps-its-word`: **refuse the
file.** A kept hunk whose sides hold a vanished baseline hunk's lines
as a contiguous run is a hunk with two authors; `collect` exits 1 with
`two authors on one hunk: <file>:<line>` before anything is staged,
and `--widen <file>` or one untouched line between the edits is the
worker's answer. Line-level matching was not taken: the interleaved
case is the one no diff can settle. Known residual: a baseline
insertion whose lines legitimately recur inside the worker's own
insertion (a lone `}`) is refused too — the cost is one `--widen`.

## Why

`collect`'s step 3 classifies a hunk as inherited when its body was in the
claim's baseline and as the worker's otherwise. `git diff -U0` merges changes
on adjacent lines into one hunk. When a foreign edit and the worker's touch
adjacent lines, the merged hunk's body is in neither baseline, `new_hunks`
returns `all`, and the whole file — foreign lines included — is committed as
the worker's. Reproduced by the `hunks-land-where-they-came-from` analyst on
its first fixture (both edits appended at EOF), 2026-08-28.

## Alternatives considered

**Diff with context (`-U1`) and split by content.** Adjacent changes still
merge; the split would have to know which lines are whose, which is the
baseline's job.

**Match the baseline line by line, not hunk by hunk.** Every `+` line of a
merged hunk that appears in the baseline's diff is inherited; the rest is the
worker's. Sound where the two authors' lines do not interleave; the case where
they do is the one no diff can settle and the worker must say so.

**Refuse the file.** A hunk whose body matches neither the baseline nor the
claim-time working file is refused with `two authors on one hunk`, and the
worker widens with `--widen` or leaves one untouched line between the edits.
The cheapest honest answer; it costs a refusal where today a wrong commit
lands silently.

## Consequences

- Until settled, a worker told to keep its edits disjoint from a sibling's is
  told to leave one untouched line between them — the library row
  `attempt-the-build` now carries it.
- Whoever takes this decides between line-level matching and refusal; the
  third road is not on the table.
