# `--vs-head` re-runs this same harness against `git show HEAD:` copies of
# the two readers and prints how many checks FAIL there. A box that passes
# against the build proves nothing on its own; a box that fails against HEAD
# is a box that can fail. Ten of the eighteen do.

# Exit 0 and a `verify: N/N` line when every case holds. The fixture is built
# in a temp dir and removed on exit — no board on this machine is touched.
#
# NOT tested, because it was measured impossible: a member board run on its
# own resolving its master's library. A member has no `settings.md` naming a
# master and carries no back-reference, so nothing can find a master from
# below. `scan` fails there identically to `check` — see the PRD's F2. The
# fix is the master direction only, and that is what these boxes cover.
