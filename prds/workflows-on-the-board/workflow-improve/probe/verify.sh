# The PRD's `## Verify` is a dry run: one worker report with two edits, one the
# atomic's fault and one the code's; the collect applies one, refuses one, moves
# `runs` 0 → 1 on the files that ran, and `check` stays silent.
#
# That dry run cannot happen on this board — `prds/workflows/` does not exist
# yet (workflow-seed writes it, and is still `open`). So the library is built in
# a temp dir at RUN TIME, and never under prds/: a file named prd.md anywhere
# below prds/ is picked up as a real PRD of this repo's own board, and a fixture
# that did that would move the counts of the board it is testing.
#
# The collect itself is performed by `collect.py` beside this file — the
# orchestrator's five actions, written down as code so the dry run can be RUN
# rather than described. Nothing in the shipped tree calls it; see the census at
# the end, which is the honest answer to "what enforces this".

# fix-a-reported-break — a reported break, from the report to the verified fix

## Use when

- someone reports something broken and the tree is the only witness

## Steps

| # | atomic                | why                                            | on failure |
|---|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1 | reproduce-the-failure | nothing is fixed until it fails first          | stop       |
| 2 | write-the-check       | a fix with no failing check is a guess         | → 1        |
| 3 | run-the-gate          | the node's work is not the tree's worst neighbour | → 2     |
