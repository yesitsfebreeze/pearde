# 7 — prds/the-board-runs-itself/readme-in-three-rings/probe/ — four literals
#     this contract moves. The matchers are honest: README claims a skill
#     count and a lookup-table size, and a twelfth skill plus one more
#     lookup row change both numbers. The rule each asserts does not move;
#     only the number it compares against does. This is outside the PRD's
#     own folder, so spec01 carries it as its own acceptance box.
# 4 — the PRD probes' literals (skill counts, table rows) were updated in
# place as later PRDs moved them again — skills/ became references/skills/
# (twelve became fourteen), and the board prds/ became .pearde/prds/. Those
# four hunks anchored on files the fixture does not carry (.pearde/ is
# gitignored) and on anchors rewritten twice since; replaying them here is
# rewriting history, so the trailer is gone. The idempotent no-op above is
# the part of this tool that still runs against the tree as it stands.
