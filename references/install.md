# Install

One explanation, for any agent. Read it, work out what your own setup calls
each thing, and make the links. Nothing here is specific to one agent, and
there is no list of agents to be on — if yours is not described below, the
last section still works.

## What the system is

Three folders, and the split between them is the whole design.

| folder | holds | who touches it |
|---|---|---|
| `skills/` | one `.md` per skill — frontmatter and a short body | an agent, as an entry point |
| `references/` | everything **read**: the workflow, personas, templates, rules | an agent, mid-task |
| `resources/` | everything **run**: the board service, scout, the status line, doctor | a shell, never read for meaning |

A skill file is thin on purpose. Its frontmatter — `name` and `description` —
is what makes it findable and what decides when it fires. Its body points into
`references/` and stops. The knowledge is not in the skill — the skill is the
door.

**The file name is the command.** `name:` must equal the file name, and an
install builds the folder from it, so `skills/pearde-view.md` is invoked as
`pearde-view` wherever it lands. Namespace and grouping are spelled into that
one name, `-` separated: `pearde-persona-ask` is the namespace `pearde`, the
group `persona`, the verb `ask`.

**`-` and not `:`.** A skill name is kebab-case — lowercase letters, digits
and hyphens, nothing else. Some agents render a *plugin's* skills as
`plugin:skill`, but that colon is put there by that agent's plugin loader,
carries exactly one level, and does not exist for a skill installed as a
folder. Writing one into a name makes the skill fail to load rather than
namespace it. The prefix is the portable namespace, and it is the whole of
it.

`@index.md` is the map both `@<path>` and `@@<keyword>` resolve against.

## What installing means

Putting each file in `skills/` where your agent looks for a skill, without
copying anything.

**The one catch.** A skill file says `Read @README.md` — a path relative to
the skill's own folder. Drop the bare `.md` file into a skills directory and
that path resolves to nothing. So a skill is installed as a *folder*, built
out of links:

```
<skills-dir>/<name>/            # <name> is the file name, minus .md
    SKILL.md    -> <repo>/skills/<name>.md
    README.md   -> <repo>/README.md
    index.md    -> <repo>/index.md
    references  -> <repo>/references
    resources   -> <repo>/resources
```

Five links, one skill, nothing copied. Read through them, every `@<path>` in
the repo resolves exactly as it does here. `@resources/install.sh` does this
for all of `skills/` in one command if you would rather not do it by hand:

```bash
bash @resources/install.sh <skills-dir>          # say what it would make
bash @resources/install.sh --apply <skills-dir>  # make it
bash @resources/install.sh --remove <skills-dir> # take it back out
```

- **Two lines.** `--apply` prints `alias pearde='python3 <repo>/resources/pearde.py'` and `export PEARDE_AS=engineer` — add both to your shell yourself. Nothing here writes a shell file. The alias is the one word; every skill file names the same `python3 @resources/pearde.py <cmd>` line, so the alias and the skills are one surface. The export is who is working: every command that moves a PRD records `· as <id>` on its line from that variable and refuses without it, per @references/parts/personas.md — `add` alone files a new PRD `· as engineer (default)`, so the first minute runs before the export is in place. `persona <id>` re-exports it.
- **Links, not copies.** One source of truth, so editing this repo updates
  every install at once. A copy drifts, and nothing says it happened.
  The links run the other way too — a session on any other board reaches
  this repo's working tree through them — so `@resources/guard.py`, where it
  is wired, refuses an `Edit` or `Write` through a link from a pass whose
  board is not this repo's, naming the real path and
  `.pearde/memos/the-install-is-live-symlinks.md`; @references/parts/guard.md
  is the row.
- **Windows** needs Developer Mode or Administrator for a symlink. Without
  it, `ln -s` in Git Bash silently *copies*. Either turn it on
  (`MSYS=winsymlinks:nativestrict`), or clone this repo straight into the
  skills directory and let `git pull` be the update path.
- **Something real already sitting where a link goes** is never replaced. It
  may hold someone's edits. Reconcile it by hand.

## Finding where the links go

You know your own setup. This repo does not. Work it out, in this order, and
stop at the first that is true.

1. **This repo is already inside a skills directory**, under the name of one
   of its own skills. If the folder holding `@SKILL.md` is itself sitting in
   the place your agent scans for skills, that slot is taken and no folder is
   built over it — the repo *is* that skill. Build the *others* as siblings.
   - **Then retire the installer.** `@SKILL.md` is the entry point that made
     this repo invocable before any of its skills were, and it answers to the
     same name as `skills/pearde.md`. Two things called `pearde` is one too
     many, and the installer is the one whose job is finished:

     ```bash
     ln -sfn skills/pearde.md SKILL.md
     ```

     Relative, so the repo survives being moved. The installer is gone, the
     board skill is live under the name it was shadowing, and `git checkout
     SKILL.md` brings the installer back to run again. git will report
     `SKILL.md` as changed from then on — that is the install, not damage.
2. **Your agent has a skills directory.** Make the folders there. Prefer the
   machine-wide one if you want the skills everywhere, the project-local one
   if you want them here only.
   - **Check which configuration is actually in force first.** Where an
     environment variable can move an agent's whole configuration directory, a
     machine can hold several profiles, and links written into the wrong one
     are correct and inert. An install that is present and broken looks
     exactly like one that is absent — that is the failure worth one extra
     command to avoid.
3. **Your agent reads one instructions file instead** — a single file it loads
   every session, whatever it is called. Append `@references/system.md` to it,
   creating it if absent. The block carries `pearde:begin` / `pearde:end`
   markers, so nothing outside them is ever read back out. A marker already
   there means installed — leave it alone, or replace what is between the
   markers if the block has changed.
   - **Substitute `<PEARDE>` for this repo's absolute path** as you write it.
     The block is going into a file belonging to some other repo, where a
     relative `@references/...` resolves against *that* tree — silently, into
     a file that is not ours or into nothing at all. The placeholder is there
     to stop exactly that.
4. **Neither.** Nothing is broken. Every skill reads where it lies — point
   yourself at `skills/<name>.md` and its `references/` and you have the whole
   system. That is a complete install, it is just one you do by hand each
   time.

Say which of the four you did, and where. That sentence is the only record
the install has.

## The status line

Optional, and separate — a skills directory has nothing to do with it.

`@resources/statusline.sh` renders `<dir> <branch> · <model>`, plus
`▸pearde <d>/<n> <p>% · open <o> <q>%` when a board is in scope. It walks up
from the working directory to the nearest board and stays silent where there
is none, so it is safe to wire globally.

- Input: the status JSON on stdin, or `$PRD_STATUS_JSON`. Output: one line.
- Wire `bash @resources/statusline.sh` wherever your setup runs a command for
  its status line. If it has no such hook, the same numbers on demand are
  `bash @resources/statusline.sh <<< '{}'`.
- `pearde guard on` in the repo the board lives in wires `python3
  @resources/guard.py` as a `PreToolUse` hook on `Bash|Read` and on
  `Edit|Write` and a `PostToolUse` hook on `Edit|Write`, and sets
  `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` beside them, in that repo's `.claude/settings.json` —
  every other key kept; `pearde guard off` takes exactly those out again.
  @references/parts/guard.md is the block it writes and the reasoning.
  Optional, and the loop runs without it — it is the loop's own rules made
  unignorable, which is worth having exactly where a pass is long enough to
  forget them. `doctor` reports it as `ok`, `off` or `broken`, and its `off`
  fix line is the command; `pearde guard status` is that row alone.
- **Compose, never overwrite.** An existing status line keeps working: export
  `$PRD_STATUS_JSON` once, call both, join the output. Only the board segment
  is this repo's — drop the dir/branch/model part if the other line shows it.
- A settings file is the user's. Print the line to add. Never write it.

## The view

Optional, one command. The board reads and plans without it. The view is how a
person looks at it and edits it. Needs Python 3 — no Docker, no account, one
loopback port.

```bash
python3 @resources/board/serve.py ensure   # start the service, register this board
```

It prints the URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8443/board/<name>`. Every registered
board is listed at `/`.

- **One daemon per machine**, singleton by port bind — `ensure` on another
  board registers it with the same service. `PEARDE_PORT` moves the port.
- **Nothing leaves the machine.** It binds `127.0.0.1`, reads the board's
  files, writes the same files back on an edit.
- `@resources/board/serve.py status` says what it watches;
  `@resources/board/serve.py stop` ends it. `@resources/doctor.sh` reports a
  board the service is not watching, and `--fix` registers it.
- Nothing lands outside a board. Each board records its own registration in
  `<board>/.state/serve.json`; the daemon holds the union in memory, logs to
  the `.state/serve.log` of the board that started it, and knows no
  machine-wide list. A daemon that is stopped and started watches nothing
  until each board is `ensure`d again — which every session start does.
- No service at all? `python3 @resources/board/plan.py gantt --open` writes
  the same render to `.pearde/.state/view.html` as one self-contained file.

## A master board

Optional, nothing to install: a board becomes the parent of several others by
naming them.

```yaml
# <parent-repo>/.pearde/settings.md
members:
  - ../mitosys/prds
  - ../model/prds
```

- The members stay where they are, boards in their own right. The parent gets
  the merged scan, the merged plan, one timeline.
- Run the pass in the parent from then on. `@resources/doctor.sh` grows a
  `members` row, and the status line marks the group `⊞N`.
- `@references/parts/master.md` is the contract.

## The first run

`pearde init` — one command, and a board exists: `.pearde/settings.md` with every
knob named, `language: English` said on its first line, `.pearde/vision.md` from
the template, the daemon watching it, `doctor` once, and the three lines to
run next — each runs as printed, with the two lines above in the shell. It
asks nothing; `pearde settings <key>=<value>` changes a knob, per
@references/settings.md. Nothing about installing does that, and nothing
about installing touches `.pearde/`.

## Uninstall

Remove the skill folders you made, or `bash @resources/install.sh --remove
<skills-dir>`. `git checkout SKILL.md` restores the installer if `--apply`
retired it. Delete the `pearde:begin`/`:end` block from the instructions file,
leaving the rest of it alone. Unwire the status line yourself — that
file is yours. Drop the alias from your shell file — it was yours to add.

`.pearde/` is your data: untouched by installing, and it survives uninstalling.
The view stops with `python3 @resources/board/serve.py stop`. Nothing else of
this system lives outside this folder except `.pearde/.state/plan.json`,
`.pearde/.state/history.jsonl` and `.pearde/.state/view.html` on each board — machine-local and
regenerable.
