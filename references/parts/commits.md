# Commits

One PRD, one commit, on the transition that lands it.

The command is `collect` — `python3 @resources/board/collect.py [<prd>…]`:
it reads the finished condition off both files, runs every spec's `## Verify
and Proof` block and the board's `gate:`, commits the paths below with the
message below, writes `commit:` and `actual:`, clears `claim:`, sets `done`,
posts the report, prints the progress line. `--dry` prints what it would add
and what it would leave. The rules on this page are what that command does,
and the scope rules are the spec of its step 3.

Commit on the transition — otherwise one working tree holds every PRD's work,
and nothing can be reviewed, reverted, or bisected on its own.

The orchestrator commits. Never a worker — two implementers committing in
parallel write each other's half-finished files into each other's commits.

| transition          | do                                                              |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `claimed → done`    | commit                                                           |
| `claimed → blocked` | commit — the work is done, the open boxes wait on something named |
| `blocked → done`    | commit what closing the boxes wrote                              |
| `claimed → failed`  | nothing. Name the dirty paths in the report, leave them on disk  |

Board state written between transitions — answers, a refine split, a memo —
rides the next commit.

**Scope: the footprint, never the tree.** Add the union of the specs'
`footprint:` and the PRD's own, plus the PRD's folder, plus any workflow file
the collect edited. Never `git add -A`, never `git commit -a` — step 5 already
proved no other `claimed` PRD writes that footprint.

- **The inherited tree is not the board's.** Step 1 records what is dirty
  before the pass starts. Those paths are never added, whatever footprint
  they fall in. Name them once in the pass.
  `collect` reads that record from `.pearde/.claims/<prd>/` — the tracked diff,
  the untracked list and the gate's output at `claim:`, written by
  `snapshot()` in @resources/board/collect.py. A dirty path outside the
  footprint is listed once and left. A dirty path inside the footprint that
  the claim predates stops the collect; `--widen <path>` takes it, and the
  message names it on a `widen:` line. A file holding inherited hunks and the
  worker's is committed by hunk: the staged blob is
  the working file with the inherited hunks reversed, each hunk at the line
  the working file has it, checked for parse and placement before the commit
  — never a patch `git apply` places — and the inherited hunks stay in the
  tree.
- **A hunk with two authors is refused, never committed whole.** Two edits
  on adjacent lines merge into one `-U0` hunk whose body is in neither the
  baseline nor the worker's diff, so `collect` exits 1 with
  `two authors on one hunk: <file>:<line>` and stages nothing;
  `--widen <file>` takes the file whole, or the worker leaves one untouched
  line between the edits.
- **The PRD's own folder is committed whole, and its `done` is in the same commit.**
  Nothing under `.pearde/prds/<prd>/` is staged by hunk or stopped as
  inherited — the record has one writer, the board — and `state: done`,
  `actual:`, the cleared `claim:` and the posted `## Report` are written
  before the commit that carries them; `commit:`, the one key that cannot
  name the commit it is in, lands in a second, one-key commit
  `<prd> — record` right behind it, so what `collect` writes never rides.
- **A parent whose children are all `done` is closed by `collect`.** With
  no spec and no open box of its own it is a container — `scan` lists it
  under collect, `claim` refuses it with `container: every child done —
  pearde collect closes it` — and `collect <parent>` sets `done`, `actual:`
  the sum of its children's, `commit:` the last child's, in one commit
  `<parent> — done: every child landed` that adds its `prd.md` alone; a
  parent with specs or boxes of its own is ordinary work.
- **Board state written between transitions rides the next collect.** An
  `answer` writes a `prd.md` no collect is about to commit; `owe()` lists
  the path in `.pearde/.claims/riders`, and the next collect on the board adds
  it and says `rides <path>` on the line.
- **A path the worker wrote outside its footprint is a wrong footprint.**
  Commit it with the rest and say so.
- **The pass that moves an interface runs the probes that assert it.** A
  commit that changes what a tool prints, where a payload sits, or whether a
  route exists can leave a landed PRD's `probe/verify.sh` red without the
  commit going red — the probe lives in the PRD folder and nothing re-runs
  it. Read the change backward: which harnesses name the moved thing in their
  `want:` lines, and run those before landing (`bash resources/doctor.sh
  --harnesses` is the whole census, one line per red harness). A probe whose
  contract moved on purpose asserts the move — `/pass`'s removal is
  asserted as a 404 — rather than going quietly red.
- **A workflow file a collect edited is added with the rest, and named in the
  message.** It is the one path in the commit that no `footprint:` declares:
  the library is the board's, not the PRD's, so the PRD's footprint does not
  grow to hold it — @references/parts/workflows.md. Name each edited file on
  its own line under the spec lines, `workflow: <slug> — <what the run
  taught>`, so the commit says which run paid for the change.

**Message.** Subject `<prd> — <what landed>`, one line per spec, `prd:` naming
the folder:

```
<prd> — <the PRD's contract in one line>

<specNN>: <goal>
<specNN>: <goal>
workflow: <slug> — <what the run taught>
widen: <path>

prd: prds/<path>
```

`workflow:` and `widen:` lines are there only when the collect took such a
path — one per file.

Write the sha to `commit:` on the PRD, beside `actual:` — the only link from a
`done` PRD to its code, and where `retry` on a regression starts.

**One commit per repo the PRD wrote.** A PRD with `repo:` elsewhere writes
code there and its record on the board: commit each where it lives, same
subject. On a master board that is the member's repo. A library that
`workflows:` points into another repo is that same rule: its edits commit
there, same subject, and never ride a commit in the repo the PRD wrote.

**Never push.** The commit is the board's, the push is the user's. Report what
is ahead and stop.

`commits: off` in `.pearde/settings.md` holds all of it — each transition then
names its dirty footprint. While on, a `*<dirty>` count climbing across passes
is a board whose commits are not landing.
