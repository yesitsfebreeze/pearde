# Install check

Telling a broken install from an absent one.

An install that is present and broken looks exactly like one that is absent.
`doctor.sh` tells them apart:

```sh
bash @resources/doctor.sh [board]         # report; exit 1 when a part is broken
bash @resources/doctor.sh --fix [board]   # report, then repair
bash @resources/doctor.sh --harnesses [board]   # …and run the board's harnesses
```

One part per line, each `ok`, `off`, or `broken`. A broken part carries the
command that repairs it. `members` reports only on a master board, and `index`
never reads `off` — the map is either right or wrong.

| part         | `off`                                  | `broken`                                                        |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `skills`     | —                                      | a skill file with no `name:`, no `description:`, or a `name:` that disagrees with its file name |
| `index`      | —                                      | @references/files.md and the tree disagree, or an `@@` keyword is undefined in @index.md |
| `statusline` | —                                      | @resources/statusline.sh renders nothing for this board                       |
| `board`      | no board                               | off the contract path, or no `language`                          |
| `members`    | not a master board — no `members:`     | an entry that is not a board on disk, or an empty list           |
| `origin`     | no PRDs to read                        | a `derived` PRD with no `from:`, or the @references/parts/derived.md tripwire live |
| `memos`      | no `memos/`                            | a memo fails the check in `@references/memo.md`                   |
| `workflows`  | no `workflows/`                        | a file fails the check in `@references/workflow.md`               |
| `questions`  | no PRDs to read                        | a round the user cannot act on — the four shapes are below        |
| `view`       | the service is not running             | it runs and this board is not registered                         |
| `plan`       | no plan on record yet                  | —                                                                |
| `harnesses`  | `harnesses:` is not `on` and `--harnesses` was not passed, or the board has no `verify.sh` | a harness exits non-zero — named, with its first `FAIL` line |

- **No agent is named in `doctor.sh`, and none is looked for.** Where a skill
  folder goes and where a status line is configured are the reader's setup,
  not this repo's — @references/install.md is that step, written to be worked
  out rather than executed. So doctor checks only what is true regardless of
  who is reading: the skill files parse, the map matches the tree, the status
  line renders, the board is on its contract.
- `skills` is about frontmatter, not placement. A skill is found by its
  `name:` and fires on its `description:`. Frontmatter that does not parse is
  a skill that silently never fires, which reads exactly like a model
  choosing not to use it. A `name:` that disagrees with the file name
  installs one skill under another's name.
- `statusline` answers the half that is ours. A line wired to a script that
  renders nothing and a line that is not wired look identical in a terminal.
  Doctor runs the script against this board and says which it is.
- `--fix` repairs one thing: a view service down or not watching this board.
  It never writes a settings file — a status line lives in the user's own.
- `questions` runs `@resources/questions.py check`, the only reader of the
  round's format. It reports four shapes, and every one of them is silent from
  the outside — a board with a broken round and a board with nothing to ask
  look identical: a `## Questions` or `## Answers` heading with nothing under
  it; a question that asks nothing, has no prepared answers to pick from, does
  not carry three, or whose recommended answer is missing or not first; an
  `## Answers` section with no `## Questions` above it, which is an answer to
  a question nobody wrote down; and a PRD parked on the user — `state:
  question`, or any parked state or `mode:` naming a human — that never says
  what it is asking. It reads `needs:` in the same pass, because a `needs:`
  holding prose instead of PRD names resolves to nothing in `plan` and is
  reported nowhere else. An answered round is history and is left alone. Not
  `--fix`-able: what a question should have asked is the one thing only its
  author knows.
- `workflows` runs `@resources/workflows.py check`, the only reader of the
  workflow format. It reads the library the way `memos` reads `memos/` —
  the closed frontmatter set, one slug key, the required sections — and the
  half no single file can see: a step naming an atomic nobody wrote, and a
  `workflow:` on a `prd.md` or a spec naming no **workflow** in the library
  — an atomic is a file, so naming one is this same failure: a route was
  asked for and a single step was found. Both are silent from the outside,
  and both send a worker nowhere. A `workflows:` pointing outside `.pearde/` is
  checked in full, not mirrored: it is this library shared between boards,
  not another system's. Not `--fix`-able — what a step should name is its
  author's to say.
- `index` runs `@resources/index.py check` over both halves of the map — the
  scopes in @index.md, the manifest in @references/files.md: a file on disk
  with no row, a row naming no file, a scope naming no file, an `@@` keyword
  nobody defined. It is not `--fix`-able — which row a new file belongs in is
  a judgement.
- `harnesses` runs the board's own acceptance checks — every `verify.sh` that
  `find` returns under `.pearde/`, and nothing else: a harness outside this board
  is not this board's business. Every PRD is closed against one, and until
  this row existed nothing ran them: no CI, no hook, no command — every green
  total on record was a person remembering to type it. **Opt-in, because it
  is slow**: this is the one row measured in tens of seconds where the rest
  answer in one, and a gate nobody can afford to run is the defect it fixes,
  repeated. `harnesses: on` in `.pearde/settings.md`, default off, or
  `--harnesses` for a single run whatever the key says.
- **A few at a time, so a red is a real red.** The sweep runs the harnesses in
  parallel but caps how many are in flight at once — `PEARDE_HCAP`, default
  **4**. Uncapped, forty-eight harnesses started together and collided over the
  three fixed ports and the board service some of them bind: in the sweep of
  2026-09-01 nearly half the reds went green on a serial re-run, so the row's
  number could not be believed without re-running every failure by hand, which
  is the work the row exists to avoid. Four is above the number of harnesses
  that actually contend at any one moment and far below the box's core count,
  so nothing waiting on a socket is starved of CPU. What it buys is isolation,
  not speed: **wall-clock is not the case for the cap** and moves either way
  between boxes. What is stable is that the uncapped run thrashes — the sum of
  the harnesses' own durations was over three times higher uncapped than
  capped on the same box, so most of an uncapped sweep's work is contention
  rather than testing. Raising `PEARDE_HCAP` trades isolation for time,
  lowering it buys no more isolation. It is an environment variable and not a
  `.pearde/settings.md` key on purpose: it is the dial for an experiment, not
  a contract surface a board is meant to tune.
- **The expected count is the harness's own — no ledger.** A recorded total
  is a second copy of a number the file already carries, and this board has
  twice paid for that shape. A harness that pins its denominator —
  `[ "$((PASS+FAIL))" = 39 ] || no "expected 39 checks, ran $((PASS+FAIL))"` —
  fails loudly when a check is dropped. One that does not prints a smaller
  total and exits 0, which is indistinguishable from success, so it is
  reported as **unpinned** rather than trusted: it is named under the row, and
  its pass does not make the row green on its own account. What doctor reads
  is the *idiom*, not the semantics — a test comparing the harness's own
  executed total against an integer literal — so `[ "$((PASS+FAIL))" = 0 ]`
  reads as pinned and asserts nothing, and a literal left behind at the wrong
  number reads as pinned until the harness is run. Nothing forces a harness to
  pin one, and nothing here fails on an unpinned harness; the row counts and
  names them, and the only thing that would enforce it is the harness's own
  author.
- A harness that runs `doctor` itself — two on this board do — gets
  `off · not run inside a harness` from the inner run. Without that guard a
  board with the key on runs doctor, which runs the harness, which runs
  doctor, and never returns.
- After repairing, doctor re-checks once — the report and exit code describe
  the state the repairs left behind. `--harnesses` survives the re-check;
  `--fix` does not repair a red harness, and cannot: what a failing assertion
  should have said is its author's to say.

Run it on the first run, on `doctor`, and whenever a part is silent when it
should not be.
