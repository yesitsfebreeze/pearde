# Weight and order

Three axes decide what runs next. None of them is a clock.

1. **Dependency** — `needs:` all `done`, every child `done` — a parked
   child holds its parent — and no footprint overlap with a `claimed` PRD.
   A hard gate: an unready PRD is not a candidate at all. The gates are one
   function, `plan.dispatchable`; `scan`'s ready band and `claim` read it.
2. **The vision axis** — asap lanes first, then depth, then `priority`. A
   PRD declaring `axis: asap` in its frontmatter is a deliberate exception —
   the "see it working" ask — and dispatches before everything, by priority.
   On-axis PRDs dispatch deepest-first: the longest serial chain first,
   because every hour it waits is an hour added to the finish. `priority`
   breaks ties within a depth. A PRD off the axis dispatches after all
   on-axis work, by priority. The axis is `.pearde/vision.md`: `terminals:`
   names the PRDs whose completion is the vision, and a PRD's depth is the
   longest serial chain from it to one, over `needs:` plus `edges:` — a
   `done` PRD on the chain costs no hop, and a parent lands after its
   children, so a parent named as a terminal puts its subtree on the axis.
   A live PRD from which no terminal is reachable is off-axis. `scan`'s
   first line carries `axis: <on> on · <off> off`, a line off the axis
   carries `· off-axis`, and `pearde vision` prints the whole axis — a
   board with no `terminals:` prints none of this and orders as above.
3. **Complexity and blast-radius** — `complexity` 1-100 is the weight the
   progress line and `plan` use. `blast-radius` breaks ties and decides what a
   pass leads with: a `high` PRD that is wrong costs more than a `low` one
   that is late.

The analyst scores `complexity` and `blast-radius` at spec time, from the specs
it just wrote — how many units, how much is unknown, how much of the tree they
touch. The orchestrator writes them on the SPECCED transition.

### The pressure order

The three axes above decide what runs next among the PRDs that *can* run. The
pressure order is the wider question — of everything on the board, what does
this pass touch first — and it is one ranking, written here once and read from
here by both ends:

| # | band | is |
|---|------|----|
| 0 | **to collect** | every acceptance box closed, a worker still holding it. One commit, and a whole frontier can open — no dispatch is cheaper |
| 1 | **waiting on you** | `question`, `blocked`, `refine`, `failed` — the four that move only when a person moves them |
| 2 | **in flight** | a worker holds it and its boxes are ticking |
| 3 | **ready now** | dispatchable this second. Inside the band, biggest door first — that ordering IS the dispatch order |
| 4 | **gated** | the rest of the plan, in schedule order |
| 5 | **parked** | `deferred` and the board's own states — weighed, scheduled by nothing |
| 6 | **landed** | `done`, laid out to the left of now |

**The cut is between 1 and 2.** Above it is what this pass can act on;
below it is what somebody is already on. That is the whole rule — every band
boundary follows from it.

`plan.py scan` prints its five sections in this order, so a pass reads the
board already sorted, and the timeline stacks its rows by it, so the top of the
chart and the top of the scan are the same claim. Inside a band the three axes
above break the tie — earliest start, then critical, then the weight it
unblocks. Progress is not a key anywhere: a bar filling as its checks land
would drag its own row up the page, and a row that moves while you read it is
what the banding is for. A PRD changes band when a state or a claim changes.

### No axis is a clock

`actual:` is a record the plan never schedules by. `est:` is a fallback: a
PRD with no `complexity` is weighed by its `est` rather than dropping to the
board average. Nothing asks an analyst to produce one, and no pass reports
hours left — wall-clock is a function of token throughput, tool latency and
contention, not a property of the work.

The one clock the board does show is fitted, not estimated: `plan.py
calibrate` reads every done PRD carrying an `actual:` across every registered
board and fits one machine-wide constant — hours per unit of weight, as a
ratio of sums so a five-minute PRD cannot outvote a three-day one, with a
P20–P80 band from the per-PRD spread. Once fitted, every weight on the board
prints as tuned real hours — weight × the fit × `TUNE`, a hand-set margin
hard-coded in `plan.py` (1.618): raise it when the board keeps finishing
late, lower it when it keeps beating the number. A bad fit can
mislabel an axis; it can never re-order the work — precisely because `est`
and `actual` stay out of the schedule, nobody ever had a reason to game them,
which is what makes them honest calibration data. Refit as `actual:` records
accumulate; the fit is dated, is per board, and lives at
`<board>/.state/calibration.json`.

The weight of one PRD, first that answers:

1. its specs — each spec's `complexity`, or that spec's `est`, summed
2. its own `complexity`
3. its own `est`
4. the average weight of every scored PRD on the board
5. `weight-default` from `.pearde/settings.md`, when nothing is scored

A parent with live children weighs zero — the work is in the children, and
weighing it too counts the same work twice. A held PRD weighs what is LEFT of
it, floored at a twentieth.

**Compute cost belongs in the spec that spends it.** GPU seconds, API calls, a
sweep priced from cached timings: real, predictable, and a legitimate reason to
scope a spec down or refuse a cell. That is a *scope* decision inside a spec,
never a *schedule* decision on a board.
