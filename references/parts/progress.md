# Progress line

The one line printed on every state change, term by term.

Print on EVERY state change. **Printed by the tool**: every transition
command — `pearde claim` · `release` · `answer` · `retry` · `unblock` ·
`defer` · `add` · `set` · `sweep` · `specced` · `refine` · `collect` — prints
it on its stdout with every term below computed from the board after the
write, and a command run from a shell says `pass file owed` before `as`. The
pass computes none of it; the one term the tool cannot know is the persona,
passed as `--as <id>` or `PEARDE_AS` in the environment.

| term       | is                                                                        |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| weight     | the PRD's `complexity`; missing counts at the average of scored PRDs, `weight-default` if none |
| `<rd>/<rn>`| `done` / all `origin: requested` — **the deliverable**                     |
| `<rp>`     | Σ weight(done, requested) / Σ weight(all requested). `failed` counts as remaining |
| `<dd>/<dn>`| `done` / all `origin: derived`. Counts, never weighted                      |
| `<o>`      | PRDs still `open`, both origins                                             |
| `<q>`      | `<o>/<n>`. A count — an `open` PRD is not scored yet                        |
| `<n>`      | the states in the @references/parts/states.md table only                   |
| a master   | every member's PRDs and its own, one set. A member's PRD is named `@<member>/<prd>` |
| `<r>`      | **ready** — dispatchable right now: `needs:` all `done`, no footprint clash with a `claimed` PRD |
| `<b>`      | **blocked** — not `done`, not ready. Name what holds the largest group      |
| `<c>`      | **to collect** — finished work still open: every acceptance box `[x]`, state not yet `done`. Omitted at zero |
| `as <persona>` | who is working, the id — @references/parts/personas.md. **Always last, never omitted**, because it is the only record of it |

- **`done` is the answer to "how far along are we".** Derived PRDs enlarge
  the denominator with work the user never requested: a board 90% through its
  deliverable reads 63% combined. Report both or neither.
- Omit the `derived` term on a board that has none.
- When the tripwire is live, say so on the line and in the pass.
- `<q>` and `<rp>` do not sum to 100 — untouched board vs requested work done.
- A parked PRD is in neither numerator nor denominator. Name it in the report.
- **`ready` and `blocked` are the actionable pair.** A board with 20 PRDs left
  and `ready 1` is not slow, it is serial. The pass says which dependency or
  which footprint holds the other 19 — a fact a reader can act on.
- **`collect` above zero is the board waiting on itself.** The work is done
  and the states have not caught up, so `ready` is under-reporting by
  whatever those PRDs unblock. Close them before reading the rest of the
  line — step 6 of @references/parts/loop.md.

**`as <persona>` is stored nowhere else.** It is session state written to no
file, so this line is the only place it is recorded — never omitted, not even
when it has not changed, and a `persona <id>` switch prints its own line in
this form though no state moved. @resources/statusline.sh reads the last one
out of the session transcript; a pass that leaves it off leaves the terminal
showing the persona before it.

The same numbers rendered continuously in the terminal are
@references/parts/statusline.md — a different reader, and nothing the loop
needs. It carries one term this line does not: where there is room here for
`derived <dd>/<dn>`, the status line renders `+<dr>d`, the derived PRDs not
yet `done`. Same rule — report both or neither — resolved for a row that can
hold one number.
