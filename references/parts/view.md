# The view

The board is files. The view is how a person reads and works them. Once per
machine:

```sh
pearde view   # `serve.py ensure` — start if needed, register this board, open the URL
```

From then on `http://127.0.0.1:8443/board/<name>` is the board, live — within
a second of any file changing it swaps the new payload in **where it stands**:
the rows move, and scroll, zoom, selection and half-typed text do not. Every
registered board is listed at `/`. `PEARDE_PORT` moves the port.

**The daemon ends its own life.** A vanished board directory is forgotten on
the next tick, and a daemon watching nothing on disk stops itself after
`PEARDE_IDLE_EXIT_S` seconds (default 180). The rule stops a harness fixture —
one pointing a daemon at a `mktemp -d` board and then deleting the board — from
leaving a process listening for days. No teardown of the fixture's can be
relied on, because a SIGKILL runs no trap and `ensure` detaches the child into
a session of its own anyway. A daemon watching one board still on disk is never
touched, whoever started the daemon and whether or not they are still alive.

`serve.py reap` clears the daemons predating the rule — every `serve.py run`
on the machine watching no board still on disk, found through the process table
because a daemon on a spare `PEARDE_PORT` answers to no port anyone remembers.
`--dry-run` names its candidates and stops nothing.

`reap` keeps anything watching a live board, anything answering for a pid other
than the one asked about, and anything younger than `PEARDE_REAP_GRACE_S`
seconds (default 60): between `ensure` binding its port and the board's first
`/register`, a daemon a `SessionStart` hook just brought up is
indistinguishable from a leak. `--pid <n>` narrows the sweep to the pids named,
standing the grace down to reach the stranded judgement without reaching a
neighbouring session's daemon inside the same window. `doctor.sh --harnesses`
ends its sweep with a `reap` — no pid named and the shipped grace kept, which
is what makes the sweep safe beside another session — and puts what stopped on
the `harnesses` row.

The verbs, all reachable as `pearde view <verb>`: `ensure`, `status`, `stop`,
`wait`, `forget`, `run`, `reap`.

**Seven views, one at a time.** The bar in the header is tabs: one section
visible, the rest hidden, and the URL names it — `#view=board` is the board.
The page opens on the plan; ⌘1–7 switch the same way. The now strip sits
above whichever view is open; the prose section opens the plan. A tab landing
on a folded one opens it.

| # | section       | answers                                                        |
|---|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **what's up** | what the board is doing and what is next, in prose — `.pearde/report.md`'s title, lede, `## In work` and `## Planned`, each cut to two or three whole sentences. A renderer, never an author. Beside it, how old the file is, off its modification time and not the dateline inside it; past a day the line says `stale` and carries the class. No file, one line naming `pearde report` |
| 2 | **timeline**  | what is in front of us — see below                                |
| 3 | **board**     | what is where — kanban by state; drag a card to write `state:`    |
| 4 | **analytics** | how this is going — where the work and weight sit, the est/actual records, the machine-wide hours-per-weight fit, weight left over time, and what a transition costs: calls per transition over the last thirty, refusals per session, both off the guard's count (@references/parts/guard.md). Calls are the proxy for tokens, named as such; no guard state at all reads `no guard`, never zero |
| 5 | **asks**      | what is waiting on *you* — every `question` and `blocked` PRD, packed in a masonry wall, and beside them the answered panel. A pass in `@references/drill.md`'s format renders as picks: the fork, its three prepared answers (the first is the recommendation, pre-selected), an own-answer box, and its own submit — per question, never one submit for the pass. A pass not in the format says so and offers "send back — rewrite as questions". An answered question leaves the cards at once and appears in the panel, newest first, where its `reopen` takes the answer back |
| 6 | **list**      | all of it — sortable, filterable, one row per PRD                 |
| 7 | **memos**     | what the board decided — `.pearde/memos/`, rendered                  |
| 8 | **report**    | the same file in full, folded — section 1 is its opening. ⌘7 |

**Three of those fold.** `list`, `memos` and `report` are archives, not
status: measured on a 41-PRD board they are 4038px of a 7065px page. Each
renders collapsed behind a summary that says what is inside — `41 PRDs ·
every state, every weight`, `13 on record · newest: …` — and opens on a click
or on the tab that lands on it. What folds is the body, by the reader's
choice. **Every section draws on the first paint**, folded or hidden, so
nothing on this page is waiting for a click to exist.

**Every board at once is `/board/all`.** The same page with no `.pearde/`
behind it: one render over every board the service is watching, built out of
their own payloads on each request and thrown away again. It gains a **boards**
section and opens on it — a card per board, the spread of its states and its
counts as doors. The page loses the report, because a report is one board's
state written for a person, and picking one of several would lie about the
rest.

`/board/all` is read-only end to end: no ＋ PRD, no save, no drag between
columns, no answer box, and the write routes answer `409`, so a click does one
thing only — take you to the board owning the row. The page is no master board
(@references/parts/master.md): a master is a board, with PRDs of its own and
one merged critical path across the members it declares, where `all` declares
nothing and computes nothing. Registering a board is the whole of joining.
@references/parts/all.md.

**The now strip is the first thing under the title**, on every view: three
doors — `to collect N` · `waiting on you N` · `in flight N` — the top three
bands of @references/parts/order.md, each a click into that set (the timeline
filtered to collect, the list filtered to the `hot` band, the list filtered to
the `held` band). Zero renders the door dimmed, never absent, so the strip is
the same shape on every board and the eye learns where to land. When a worker
in flight has gone silent the door says how many.

**Nothing that is git-ignored is rendered for a person.**
A file git ignores is machine scratch: `.pearde/.state/pass.md` holds one
session's own memory (@references/parts/pass.md), `.pearde/.state/plan.json`
and `.pearde/.state/history.jsonl` hold the board's. Each is true only at the
instant of writing, and each is written in the board's own vocabulary — states,
footprints, commit shas — the one register @@report forbids in the document a
person reads. The view draws tracked files and nothing else.

The rule is prose, and prose is no mechanism: enforcement would be a check
running `git check-ignore -q` over every path the view fetches, and no such
check exists.

**Every number is a door.** A count, a swatch, a bar, a column head — if it
names a set of PRDs, clicking it goes there: `5 waiting on you` opens **asks**,
`189w to the vision` filters the timeline to the critical chain, `137 done`
opens that list, a legend swatch filters by state. Nothing on the page is a
dead end, and the URL follows, so where you are is a link you can send.

**The timeline's x axis is not time** — agents start when work is
dispatchable, so a date on a bar is a staffing guess. The dependency structure
is no guess. The axis is weight along the **critical path**, and spans the
**whole track**: done work laid out by the same dependency arithmetic to the
LEFT of zero ending at now, the plan to the right, the right edge the vision
reached. Where you are is a place on the track, and the header says what
percent of the track lies behind you. Once `calibrate` has fitted the machine's hours-per-weight
(see @references/parts/order.md), every weight on the page prints as tuned
real hours — header, tiles, vision pill, axis, drawer; before the first fit
they print as raw weight units. Parked PRDs — `failed`, `deferred`, the user's own states — sit
at zero: visible, weighed, and scheduled by nothing. Under the numbers the
page prints the one sentence `.pearde/vision.md` declares — the payload's
`vision.purpose`, empty on a board with no vision, and then no line.

- **★ critical** marks the chain that sets the finish. Weight cut there moves
  the vision closer. Weight cut anywhere else moves nothing.
- **float** is the tail behind a bar: how late it may start before it becomes
  critical.
- **ready now** is the frontier at zero, ordered by how much work each PRD
  unblocks. That ordering *is* the dispatch order. A PRD a worker already
  holds is absent from the frontier — filed under **to collect** or nowhere.
- **to collect** leads the frontier: finished work still open on the board.
  It comes first because closing one costs a commit and can open a whole
  frontier, which no dispatch can do. `x` filters to it, `#collect=1` links
  to it.
- a **footprint clash** is a pairwise `after` edge, named on the row — real,
  and what `dispatch` will serialise on the in-flight set — but it moves no
  bar here: the plan's structure is `needs:` alone, so a clashing pair may
  draw side by side. No waves and no passes exist: a barrier would hold every
  unrelated PRD for the slowest member of a pass, and agents do not work in
  passes — each one starts the moment its own gates clear. `pearde plan`'s
  own text prints the other honest number beside this one — the ceiling, what
  the calendar would total if every clash here really did serialise; this
  view draws the floor alone.
- The header names the **peak agent count** the fastest path asks for,
  computed with unlimited agents: `workers:` is `dispatch`'s own cap here for
  display, not a fact this schedule uses, so it moves no bar. `plan --workers
  N` prints a second, deliberate view on the command line — the staffed
  simulation under that many agents — for a board that wants to see what a
  real budget costs.
- **dates** (or `v`) draws the same bars on the worker-limited calendar, at
  `gantt-day` weight per day.

**The y axis is pressure, not the schedule.** Read top to bottom by start
date, the one PRD asking you a question sits three hundred rows down, and a
board you have to hunt through is a board nobody glances at. Rows stack in the
pressure order — to collect, waiting on you, in flight, ready now, gated,
parked, landed — which is @references/parts/order.md's ranking and the same one
`plan.py scan` prints a pass in. The top of the chart and the top of the scan
are one claim. Inside a band the plan arithmetic breaks the tie: earliest
start, then critical, then the size of the door it opens.

The bands apply inside every grouping, and in **tree** a branch is as pressing
as the most pressing thing inside — a folded parent holding one `question`
rises carrying the question. Tree is one click away and is not what a board
opens on: under tree, a container's aggregate track and the landed work inside
an early branch sit above the run happening right now.

**A name rides its own work.** No column of names stands to correlate
against: a PRD's name is written inside its pill where the pill can hold the
name, and floating just off the end where the pill cannot — off the *start*
instead when the end is against the right edge — with the remainder beside it,
boxes while a worker holds the PRD and weight otherwise. Ink inside a pill is
chosen from that pill's own colour, and so reads legibly on a near-white `open`
and a near-black `specced` alike.

Two names can want one patch of canvas, and at six pixels a row most of them
do. Rows sit in the pressure order, so placement is greedy from the top: to
collect, waiting on you, in flight and ready claim their names first, and the
settled tail loses one to a collision. A row without its name keeps its bar,
its hover and its click — the name is the cheapest thing on a row to drop, and
the only part able to go without the work going too.

`names` (or `t`) brings the old column back for when a sorted list of names is
the thing you want; it slides in rather than appears, and the plan re-lays out
under it. At dense row heights that column staggers into two, each name still
on its own row's centre line and its row banded behind it, because the band is
what pairs a name to a bar.

**Both axes fit the window.** `ppu` fits the weight across. Down, the **row
rail** on the plot's own left edge is a slider between the two honest answers:
at the top every row stands at its full reading height and the board scrolls;
at the bottom the whole board is on the screen and the rows are as short as
that takes. Neither end suits every board, hence a rail and not a rule.

The rail runs the axis it scales — up is the tall row, and the two end caps are
the legend: two fat rows above, four thin ones below. Drag the rail anywhere,
wheel over it, click an end, or arrow the thumb; hold shift for the fine grain.
Hovering, and every move, says the pitch in pixels and how many rows the pitch
puts on the screen. Row height keeps two clamps — a ceiling so four PRDs are
not four fat stripes, and a floor below which a bar stops being a shape, past
which the remainder scrolls.

**The plan opens on the default view** — now at the plot's left edge, the
vision at its right, and the rows scaled until every row is on the screen. The
default is what the page loads on, what a mode switch re-establishes on the new
axis, and what a resize keeps; `d` puts it back.

The `view` dropdown in the plan's toolbar holds the default and every other
framing: the axis's three named scales (`fine` `mid` `whole` on vision, `day`
`week` `month` on dates), `fit all` (or `f`) for the whole track with landed
weight included, and `custom`. Nobody chooses `custom` — a wheel, a `+`/`−` or
a hand on the row rail lands there, and the entry sits in the list so the
control can say the plot has left a framing.

**Two cards, not one.** The plan and **focus** sit side by side with air
between them, and focus pushes in and out from the right — `focus` (or `L`).
The plan takes the width back as it goes. The stage takes whatever height the
page has left under it, measured rather than guessed, so a wrapped toolbar
never pushes the legend off the bottom and never leaves dead page under it.

**The plan moves while the work does.** The live service reconciles every
board it watches — not only masters — so a bar re-sizes and everything
downstream of it slides within about a second of the file that moved.

A state is written twice per PRD — once on dispatch, once on return — so a
view reading only states stands still for the whole run the view means to
show. The acceptance boxes move continuously, and the view reads them:

| on the page                | is                                                                  |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| the solid part of a bar    | the fraction of that PRD's acceptance boxes an implementer has closed |
| the ghosted part           | what it has not proven yet. The edge between them moves as boxes close |
| `6/8` beside a name        | the same count, for a PRD in flight. It replaces the weight, which is already what is left |
| a shrinking bar            | a held PRD weighs what is **left** of it, so the chain shortens as the run lands checks |
| **✓** before a name        | every box closed — this one is yours to collect                      |
| `implementer-1 holding 40m`| off `claim:`, in the tooltip and the pane. Counted in the page, so it ticks between board changes |
| `silent 42m` beside it     | nothing under the PRD directory or its footprint union in `repo` has moved for longer than `claim-ttl` (`settings.md`, default 30m). Below the limit the row says only `holding`. In amber, in the column's meta and on the bar's label too: the one word in the column that asks for a person. `scan` prints the same word on the same line — one rule, `silent_of` in @resources/board/silence.py, read by both and the one `sweep` acts on. Read off files, never off a process: the board cannot see a worker, and a file that has not moved is the only honest signal. A PRD to collect is never silent — its worker finished |

- The signal is evidence, never a guess: a box is `[x]` because a check ran.
- A worker that ticks nothing shows no progress. That is correct — an
  unproven run has produced nothing the board can schedule around.

**With `names` on, that column is the board's own tree** — under `group: tree`,
which is one click from the urgency order a board opens on. A PRD's children sit indented
under it, a member board is the root of everything under it, and a branch
opens and closes from its `▸`. Two things decide whether a branch is open, in
that order: what you last clicked, and — for every branch you have not touched
— whether any of its subtree falls inside the window you are looking at. Pan
or zoom past a branch and it folds itself away, carrying a thin bar that says
how far its work reaches; pan back and it opens again. A closed branch's row
still reads its whole subtree: how many PRDs, their weight, how many are
critical. Clicking a container's name opens the PRD; clicking its caret folds
it. `group` picks what the rows stack by — `urgency` (the pressure order, flat,
and what a board opens on), `tree`, state, parent, board — and `collapse all`
shuts or opens every branch at once. Pressure bands inside whichever is picked.

The chart is one canvas, drawn virtualised — a 40-PRD board and a 4000-PRD one
cost the same. Greyscale carries the plan — state is ink weight, not hue — and
the only colour on the page is the amber and red of the states that want a
person.

| do | to |
|---|---|
| drag | pan |
| ctrl/⌘+wheel | zoom at the pointer |
| `d` | the default view — now to the vision, every row on the screen |
| `f` | fit the whole track |
| drag the column edge | widen the names, when `names` is on |
| drag the left rail | row height — wheel it too, shift for fine |
| `↑` `↓` | move the selection |
| `⏎` | open it |
| ⌘1–7 | switch view |

**Clicking anything opens the PRD**, and the pane writes back:

- title, `state`, `priority`, the body, and a note appended to `## Notes`.
- On a `question` PRD, the pass itself — each fork with its three prepared
  answers as radio picks (the first is the recommendation, pre-selected), an
  own-answer box, and its own `answer Qn` button, which writes that pick under
  `## Answers` (`**Q1** — <text>`). No pass-level submit exists. A
  `## Questions` section not in @references/drill.md's format is flagged as
  not answerable and falls back to raw text, a free textarea, and a "send
  back — rewrite as questions" button that replies so under `## Answers` and
  reopens the PRD.
- A `blocked` PRD's wall renders the same way when it is written as a pass.
  The heading is matched by prefix, so `## Blocked on a human with a browser`
  is the same section as `## Blocked`.
- **Each question answers on its own.** `answer Q1` writes that one under
  `## Answers` and leaves the rest of the pass open. The PRD only goes back
  to `open` when nothing in the pass is left unanswered.
- Which questions are already answered is read off `## Answers`, not
  remembered by the page — a redraw, a reload and a second reader all agree,
  and nothing is answered twice.
- An answer is written as `**Q1** *(answered 2026-08-28 14:22)* — <the
  decision>`. The id opens the line and the decision follows the dash, as
  before; the stamp is what the answered panel orders by. A line written
  before the stamp existed still reads — it sorts under the dated ones.
- **Each answered question carries its own `reopen`** — in the pass where it
  stands, and on its row in the answered panel. Reopening removes its
  `**Qn**` line from `## Answers` and parks the PRD on the user again, so
  every reader agrees off the file. A PRD still `question` — the rest of its
  pass is unanswered — is asked for no state at all: the transition refuses a
  move to the state a PRD already holds, and a retract that landed must not
  be reported as a write that failed.
- **A write that half-landed is not a failure.** `/edit` applies each part of
  a payload in order and reports every one that took in `wrote`; an answer
  appended and a state the transition refused come back together in one 409.
  The page reads `wrote` first and `error` second, so the answer counts as
  written and the toast says only that the PRD has not moved. Reporting the
  whole call as failed sent the reader back to `answer Qn`, whose second
  press the service refuses as a duplicate of the line already on disk —
  a pass where nothing but resubmitting appeared to work.
- The **asks** view is that same pass for every waiting PRD at once. It
  renders exactly what the inspector renders — the same picks, the same
  prose, the same per-question buttons — because both build from the same
  parse. A `blocked` PRD with no `## Blocked` section and no pass is flagged
  the same way, not dumped as PRD body.
- **The answered panel** is the right half of that view: every question the
  board has settled, newest answer first, each row the question, the decision
  and the PRD it belongs to — click one to open that PRD. The panel is read
  over `GET /answers` out of the PRDs themselves, so it holds answers from PRDs
  long since reopened, not only from the ones still asking. A
  question answered here leaves its card in the same motion, so the cards
  hold open forks only and going through a pass is a list that empties.
- `+ PRD` (or `n`) writes a new one.
- Every write goes through @resources/board/edit.py: one line at a time,
  atomically, frontmatter and body never in the same write.
- A worker's report lands via `POST /report` (`{"board","prd","text"}` →
  `## Report`).
- `GET /report` serves `.pearde/report.md` as `{"text": <file or null>}`, read
  from disk on each call like `/prd`. `/pass` is gone: the page dropped the
  panel, and a route nothing fetches is a door to nowhere.

Deep links: `#prd=<rel>` opens one PRD, `#view=asks` a view, `#state=blocked`
a filtered list, `#crit=1` the critical chain, `#collect=1` the finished work
waiting to be closed.

```sh
python3 @resources/board/plan.py plan         # the frontier and the queue, to stdout
python3 @resources/board/plan.py reconcile    # re-order it, keep the anchor
python3 @resources/board/plan.py gantt --open # the same view as one HTML file
python3 @resources/board/plan.py status       # the board, its members, its memos
python3 @resources/board/serve.py wait        # block until the board moves
```

`gantt` writes `.pearde/.state/view.html` — the same render, self-contained, no service
needed. It loses only what needs the service: the detail pane's live read and
every edit.

**Being woken, not polling.** `serve.py wait` sleeps in the kernel and exits
the moment anything on the board moves, printing what did. Park it in the
background at session start, and whenever a pass ends with work still open.

**What the board keeps.** `.pearde/.state/plan.json` is the last plan.
`.pearde/.state/history.jsonl` is one row a day — the only memory the board has, and
what the burn-down draws. `.pearde/.state/transitions.jsonl` is one row a transition,
appended by the transition commands, carrying the guard's count for the window
before it — what the cost series draw. All are machine-local, so gitignore
them:

```
.pearde/.state/plan.json
.pearde/.state/history.jsonl
.pearde/.state/transitions.jsonl
.pearde/.state/view.html
```

**Extending it.** A board styles and scripts its own view. Two optional files
at the board root, inlined into the page after everything the skill ships:

| file                 | is                                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `.pearde/view.user.css` | rules that win the cascade over the skill's own  |
| `.pearde/view.user.js`  | a script that runs against a built page          |

- They belong to the **board**, never to the skill — a skill upgrade leaves
  them untouched, and two boards extend differently.
- A board with neither renders exactly what it renders without this.
- Editing either reloads the open page within about a second. They are board
  content, so the daemon never re-execs for them.
- A `</style>` or `</script>` inside one is escaped, not honoured.
- Gitignore them with the rest, or commit them — the board's call.

`window.pearde` is what a script may use. Nothing else is a contract:

| member      | is                                                       |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `data`      | the enriched payload the page is drawing, `cpm` included  |
| `board`     | the board key this page was rendered for                  |
| `refresh()` | re-fetch the payload and swap it in place                 |
| `apply(p)`  | swap a payload in without fetching                        |
| `onHold(f)` | hold live updates while `f()` returns true                |

```js
// .pearde/view.user.js — pause the live swap while a dialog of your own is open
pearde.onHold(() => document.body.classList.contains("my-dialog-open"));
```

**Your own element in the page.** `view.user.js` is a module, and Lit ships
with the view, so a board writes a component and the page renders it. The
browser owns that contract, so no plugin API waits to be learned beyond where
an element goes.

| seam        | where it renders                         |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| `toolbar`   | under the numbers, above the view         |
| `sidebar`   | floating at the bottom right of the page  |
| `inspector` | inside the PRD panel, above its buttons   |

- `pearde.slot(name, tag)` renders one registered element into one seam.
- Every slotted element gets the payload as its `data` property, updated on
  every live swap.
- A seam with nothing registered renders nothing — no wrapper, no gap.
- An unknown seam name is ignored, never an error.
- Registering after the page has painted works.

```js
// .pearde/view.user.js — a panel of your own, fed by the board
import { LitElement, html } from "lit";

class BoardAge extends LitElement {
  static properties = { data: {} };
  render() {
    return html`<b>${this.data?.all?.length ?? 0} PRDs</b>`;
  }
}
customElements.define("board-age", BoardAge);
pearde.slot("sidebar", "board-age");
```

**Replacing a whole view.** A custom element name is unique per document, so
a board cannot define its own `pearde-list` over the page's. It registers an
element of its own and takes the view instead:

```js
// .pearde/view.user.js — this board draws its own list
import { LitElement, html } from "lit";
class MyList extends LitElement {
  static properties = { data: {} };
  createRenderRoot() { return this; }
  render() { return html`<div>${this.data.all.length} PRDs</div>`; }
}
customElements.define("my-list", MyList);
pearde.replace("list", "my-list");
```

- `board`, `asks`, `list`, `analytics`, `memos` and `report` can be
  replaced. The timeline cannot: a canvas the plan arithmetic draws.
- `now` and `whatsup` — the door strip and the prose section above the plan —
  are replaced the same way: `pearde.replace("now", "my-now")` puts the element
  in the strip's place and hands it the payload on every swap.
- The page stops drawing a view it has handed over.
- A replaced view gets the payload as `data` on every swap, like a seam.
- An unreplaceable name is ignored, never an error.

**Checking a change.** `node @resources/board/viewtest.js .pearde/.state/view.html`
opens the rendered page in a real browser and reports what the page built —
Lit bound, every seam, every view. `viewtest.js` needs `playwright-core`
installed where you run it, and exits 2 saying so on an absent install.

`--snap <dir>` writes every view's markup and text. `--check <dir>` compares
against it, so a change to how a view is built is provable rather than
eyeballed — the text a reader sees must not move.

Give the served URL as well as the file — `node @resources/board/viewtest.js
http://127.0.0.1:8443/board/<name>`. The two are different code paths, and a
page correct as a file can be broken as a service.

`--check` compares a page against a board in a known state. A moved PRD
changes what the views draw, and every check fails for that reason alone.
Snapshot the board, change the code, compare — never across a pass.
