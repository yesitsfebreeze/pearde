# Worker briefs

The exact text to hand an analyst and an implementer.

A worker's prompt is the brief **command**, never its output:

```
Run `python3 <resources>/pearde.py brief <prd> --worker <name> --as <id>` and follow its output as your whole brief.
```

The worker runs it in its own window, so the brief — eight kilobytes, two
thousand tokens — is paid for by the window using it and never enters the
pass's, which is what lets one pass dispatch twenty workers in one turn. The
claim a worker's own `brief` re-reads is not a refusal when the worker named is
the one asking. `@` and `@@` resolve in @index.md.

**Dispatch to the named type, never to a general one.** An analyst is
`pearde-analyst`, an implementer is `pearde-implementer`, and the pass itself
is `pearde-pass` — `references/agents/` in this repo, installed alongside the
skills. The type carries the model: an analyst specs off a settled contract and
runs on the cheaper one; an implementer writes the code and does not. Dispatched
as `general-purpose`, a worker runs the orchestrator's own model on a job that
never needed it, with no way for the board to tell afterwards.

**The pass is a worker too.** The session the user asked dispatches
`pearde-pass` and holds nothing else — @references/parts/dispatch.md. The
orchestrator these briefs speak of is itself a window that ends, and the rule
below is why it stays small enough to be worth ending.

**A launch is not a life.** An async dispatch reports success even when the
worker dies on its first API call — 402, 429, a model group with no fallback.
Before the turn ends, verify each worker is alive: its transcript under the
harness tasks dir must grow, and must hold no `API Error`. One dead worker is
re-dispatched once, on the orchestrator's own model — never on the fallback
that just killed it. A second death is `BLOCKED`, with the error text. The same
check re-runs before any return: a worker stopped without a report is dead, not
thinking.

**A report is a file. What comes back is one line.** Every brief ends by saying
so: the worker writes `.pearde/prds/<prd>/report.md` and returns the verdict,
that path, and the numbers the next command takes — under fifteen lines. The
orchestrator reads the file only where the line is not enough to move the PRD,
and never to re-read what `pearde collect` already parses — the verdict routing
least of all: `pearde collect <prd> --report <the report's path>` does that
lookup now. A report returned whole is pinned in the orchestrator's window for
the rest of the session, and every turn after it pays again.

Rules for every worker:

- Never edit frontmatter, never touch other PRDs, never write outside the PRD
  folder. Implementers also write the target repo.
- Open the brief with one line naming the worker's persona — `Work as
  @references/personas/<id>.md.` — read off this table, never asked, and moving
  nothing about the session's own. This table is the whole of it: a dispatch
  never opens @references/parts/personas.md, which answers a different question
  — who works the *session*.

  | the job                                                        | wears      |
  |----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
  | the contract is user flow, product shape, or a user-facing name | `designer` |
  | re-checking finished work, or a `failed` post-mortem            | `skeptic`  |
  | anything else — every ordinary analyst and implementer          | `engineer` |
- Write per `@@language`, in the board `language` from `.pearde/settings.md` —
  named in the brief. On a master board, the language of the PRD's **own**
  board.
- A report that is incomplete, or a worker stopped mid-task: continue THAT
  worker — it holds the context. Never respawn it.
- Report a defect found outside your scope. Do not file it and do not fix it.
  Say what is wrong, what you measured, and which requested PRD would go
  wrong because of it. The orchestrator decides what it becomes, per
  @references/parts/derived.md.
- Two rules for **contested or load-bearing claims** — never for every sentence
  of a routine report, which states what was done and quotes its verify output,
  nothing more: a measured claim gets `reproduced`, `refuted` or `unmeasured`
  with the fixture named beside it, and a census enumerates its population
  rather than the members it already knows — a check written from the answer
  passes on the answer.

**Every worker, on top of its role.** `pearde brief` prints this last:

<!-- brief:every -->
> Write in `<language>`, per @references/language.md. Never edit frontmatter,
> never touch another PRD, never write outside `.pearde/prds/<prd>/` and the
> footprint. A defect outside your scope goes in the report, not into a fix.
> Look up a word in your contract you do not know with `python3
> resources/grammar.py show`; a word you needed and it does not define goes in
> your report rather than being invented.
> A fact learned outside this repo — the web, a library this tree does not
> hold — is written back with `python3 resources/knowledge.py remember`
> (`conclude` once two sources agree), never left standing only in this report.
> Write your report to `.pearde/prds/<prd>/report.md`. Its **first 40 lines**
> must carry a line beginning `Verdict:` and then the one word your role's
> block names — nothing else on that line, and not inside a list item or a
> block quote, both read as no verdict at all. `pearde collect` reads that line
> and nothing else to pick the transition, and a report whose first 40 lines
> carry none is refused with nothing written. Then return one line — the
> verdict, that path, and the numbers the orchestrator's command takes — under
> fifteen lines back, whatever the report holds.
<!-- /brief -->

**Placeholders.** `pearde brief` fills these and nothing else. A placeholder is
`<name>` — lowercase, `_` or `/` inside; one a block uses and this table does
not name, a row nothing uses, or a marker pair missing or unterminated, is the
`doctor` row `briefs`.

| placeholder | filled from |
|---|---|
| `<prd>` | the PRD's real path under `.pearde/prds/` — never `@<member>/…` |
| `<repo>` | the PRD's `repo:` when it is a directory, else the member's repo root, else the board's |
| `<language>` | `language` in the PRD's own board's `settings.md` |
| `<probe>` | `.pearde/prds/<prd>/probe/` — where probe code lives |
| `<board>` | the board whose library holds the slug, for `workflows.py brief` |
| `<split_above>` | `split-above` in the PRD's own board's `settings.md`, default 40 — @references/settings.md |
| `<specs_above>` | `specs-above` there, default 6 |
| `<health>` | `health.py list --under <health-floor>` over the PRD's footprint union, one line per file, worst first — or `none under the floor`, or `no health record — pearde health score writes one`. @references/health.md |
| `<slug>` | the `workflow:` the block is printed for — in the analyst block it is the worker's to write |
| `<id>` | `--as`, default `engineer`; `--consult <id>` |
| `<transcript_path>` | `--transcript` |
| `<prds/>` | the board path |
| `<the question, as the user put it>` | `--question` |

**The workflow block.** When the PRD (or, for an implementer, a spec) carries
`workflow: <slug>`, this opens the brief immediately after the persona line,
verbatim, placeholders filled — nothing else about the brief changes:

<!-- brief:workflow -->
> Follow the workflow `<slug>`: `python3 @resources/workflows.py brief <slug>
> <board>` prints it — the steps in order, each with its atomic inlined. Take
> the steps in order. When a step fails, go where its `on failure` says; a
> back-edge is taken at most twice, then stop and report with the step named.
> Your report carries `## Workflow <slug>` per @references/workflow.md: one
> row per step, and under `### Edits` the replacement text for every failure
> the atomic caused — a wrong command, a stale path, a check that cannot
> fail, a shape `## Fails when` does not list. Never edit the workflow files
> yourself.
<!-- /brief -->

- No `workflow:` anywhere: no block, and the brief is exactly as before.
- A spec with its own `workflow:` — the implementer follows that one for that
  spec and the PRD's for the rest, so the brief carries one block per distinct
  slug and the report one `## Workflow` section per workflow followed.
- **A worker never writes under `workflows/`.** Edits go in the report; what
  becomes of them is @references/parts/workflows.md.
- A slug naming no workflow is a broken PRD, not a silent one: not dispatched
  until the key is fixed or removed. `python3 @resources/workflows.py check`
  reports it and `plan.py scan` marks the line `wf <slug>?` — naming an atomic
  marks the same way, a route was asked for and a single step was found.
- A member's worker resolves the slug against its own board's library first,
  then the master's — the order `needs:` resolves in.

**On return, either brief.** `## Workflow <slug>` present in the report is a
route already run, and the run is what improves it. The five actions are
@references/parts/loop.md step 6, in the same batch as the collect: read the
rows, apply the edits whose failure was the atomic's and refuse the rest saying
which, `runs` +1 on the workflow and every atomic that ran with `updated:
<today>` where the text changed, `python3 @resources/workflows.py check` before
the commit, and the changed files on the PRD's commit. Absent, nothing is
collected and the PRD's transition is unchanged either way — the verdict
decides the state, and a `stopped` row does not.

**Analyst** — one per `open` PRD being probed:

<!-- brief:analyst -->
> Query the record first: `python3 resources/knowledge.py query "<the PRD's
> question>"` from `<repo>`, the contract as the question. A gap
> auto-enqueues into `.pearde/wiki/pending/` — note it in the report, it is
> not a question of your own to ask. Run `python3 @resources/workflows.py
> list <board-of-this-prd>` too, and follow the workflow whose `## Use when`
> fits the build ahead, as you would one the PRD already carries. Then read
> `.pearde/prds/<prd>/prd.md`,

> spec from reading. Attempt the implementation in `<repo>` and keep going
> until it works or until it hits something undefined. The attempt is the

<!-- /brief -->

On return, hand the report itself to the tool: `pearde collect <prd> --report
<the report's path>` reads the verdict word and runs the transition it maps to
— `specced` with the `## Scores` values, a route draft on stdin when the slug
is one the library did not hold, `refine` off the `## Split` table, `release`
for QUESTION, BLOCKED and FAILED — every gate the command checks still running,
a missing or unknown verdict refused with nothing written, a red verify still
exit 1. The lookup is no longer yours and the file is no longer read for it;
what stays prose is the judgment the tool cannot make: whether to believe the
report at all, and whether a `## Workflow` edit was the atomic's fault or the
code's. Believing it and it being wrong is the collect's gate to catch, not the
line's. The probe code stays in the tree either way; a PRD abandoned with probe
code is named in the report, so the sweep reads it as pass one and not as
damage.

**Implementer** — one per `specced` PRD dispatched:

<!-- brief:implementer -->
> Read `.pearde/prds/<prd>/prd.md` and every file in `specs/`. The tree already
> holds the probe's uncommitted code — continue it, it is pass one; the specs
> were written from it. Implement the specs in `<repo>`. Run each spec's `## Verify and Proof` block and the repo's own gate. Tick a
> box `[x]` only for a check you actually ran, quoting output — and tick it
> **as you close it**, not in a batch at the end: those boxes are the board's
> only live view of your run, and the plan is drawn from them. If blocked,
> STOP and report **BLOCKED** with the exact question or wall — do not guess,
> do not redefine the spec. Return **DONE** (per-spec box status + verify
> output) or **FAILED** (what broke, what you tried); on FAILED also write
> `## Failure` into `prd.md`.
> Files in your footprint under the health floor, worst first — leave each
> better than you found it inside the spec's scope, never a refactor, and
> say in the report what moved or why nothing could; a split is a defect
> outside scope, reported, not done:
> <health>
<!-- /brief -->

On return, the same one call as the analyst's: `pearde collect <prd> --report
<the report's path>`. DONE routes into collect's own seven steps, BLOCKED into
`release blocked` — the `needs:` key is the gate's to refuse on — and anything
less into `release failed`, `## Failure` written first by the worker or written
by `--fail`. Every open box the tool re-checks on its own; the report's word is
never taken for the verify. What stays the orchestrator's
is the belief and the `## Workflow` rows, as above.

Two unclosable boxes, caught at the gate rather than by eye: `pearde specced`
refuses a box asking the worker to commit — committing is not an implementer's
act — and warns on a `## Verify and Proof` block naming no path under the
footprint, because a whole-workspace command measures the tree's worst
neighbour, not this node's work.

A spec asking to change **another** PRD's body is the orchestrator's edit on
that transition. The worker reports the wording — one writer per file holds.

**Consultant** — one per call, per @references/parts/consult.md. Called by the
orchestrator on its own judgment as often as by the user's `ask <id>
<question>`. The persona is chosen for the question, not the job, and the consultant's is
the only brief producing no state change:

<!-- brief:consultant -->
> Work as `@references/personas/<id>.md`.
>
> The session asking you is `<transcript_path>`. The board is `<prds/>`, the
> repo `<repo>`. Read what you need from them — search for what bears on the
> question, never read the transcript whole.
>
> Question: `<the question, as the user put it>`
>
> Answer it. Say what you read to answer, and say plainly where the transcript
> did not settle it rather than filling the gap — an invented answer in your
> voice is worse than none, because it arrives wearing a persona's authority.
> Disagreeing with what the session has already concluded is the job, not a
> problem: say so, and say on what evidence.
>
> This is a conversation. Ask one clarifying question back if the question
> cannot be answered as put — that is working, not failing. Expect follow-ups
> on your answer, and answer those from what you have already read rather than
> starting over.
>
> Write nothing. No PRD, no frontmatter, no spec, no code, no commit, no file
> anywhere. A change you think is needed goes in your answer as a
> recommendation. Do not print a `▸ … · as <id>` line.
<!-- /brief -->

While the consult is open: keep it. Follow-ups, disagreements and its own clarifying
questions go to the consultant you already have — it holds the exchange, and a
fresh dispatch is a different colleague who has read none of it. The rule is
the same one governing a stopped worker: continue THAT one, never respawn it.

On return: relay the answer attributed to the persona, then respond to it in
your own voice. Nothing about the board moves on a consult — a recommendation
worth acting on becomes an ordinary transition in the pass that follows, made
by the orchestrator, through the same gates as everything else.
