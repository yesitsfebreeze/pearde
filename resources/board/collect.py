"""pearde collect — close a finished PRD in one call: verify, commit, done.

    collect [<prd>…] [--dry] [--fail] [--trust] [--widen <path>]…
            [--also <path> --also-note <text>] [--as <id>] [--board <path>]
    collect --snapshot <prd>          what `claim` records, until it does

For each PRD named — or every PRD in `scan`'s **collect** section when none
is — the seven steps of @references/parts/loop.md step 6, in order:

  1  the finished condition off both files      `standing()` in plan.py
  2  every spec's `## Verify and Proof` block    run in `repo`, output kept
     then the board's `gate:`                    against the claim's baseline
  3  the paths: specs' footprints ∪ the PRD's ∪ the PRD dir ∪ `--also`
     — the PRD's own folder is the board's record: added whole, always —
       never by hunk, never a stop
     — a dirty path outside it is inherited: listed, never added
     — a dirty path inside it that the claim predates: exit 1, `--widen`
     — a file holding both: only the hunks the claim does not predate,
       staged as the working file with the inherited hunks reversed,
       and the staged blob checked for parse and placement before 4
     — a hunk that is in neither the baseline nor the worker's diff —
       two edits on adjacent lines, merged by `-U0` — is refused:
       `two authors on one hunk: <file>:<line>`; `--widen` takes the
       file whole, or the worker leaves one untouched line between
  4  the record — `actual:` written, `claim:` cleared, `done`, the report
     posted — then one commit per repo, message per
     @references/parts/commits.md; everything collect wrote is in it
  5  `commit:` — the one key that cannot be in the commit it names — in a
     second, one-key commit `<prd> — record`, right behind
  6  `POST /report` to the daemon when it is up — before the commit, so
     `## Report` is in it
  7  the progress line, the transition row

A container — a parent whose every child is `done`, with no spec and no
open box of its own — has nothing to verify and nothing to commit but its
record. `dispatchable()` in plan.py is the one word for it (`container:
every child done — pearde collect closes it` — what `claim` refuses on and
`scan` lists under collect with), and `close_container()` here sets `done`,
`actual:` the sum of the children's, `commit:` the last child's, in one
commit `<parent> — done: every child landed`. A parent with specs or an
open box of its own is ordinary work, and its boxes decide it.

A step that stops writes nothing after it. The worker's word is never taken
for the verify: `--trust` is the orchestrator's word, said on the line.

**The baseline.** "The claim predates it" is answered by what `claim`
recorded under `.pearde/.claims/<prd>/` — the tracked diff, the untracked
list, the gate's output — through `snapshot()` here. With no record, a
file's mtime against the claim's timestamp decides for the whole file, and
the gate has no baseline to be measured against, so it has to exit 0.

**Board state written between transitions rides.** `answer` writes a
`prd.md` no collect is about to commit; `owe()` lists that path in
`.pearde/.claims/riders` and the next collect on the board adds it and names
it on the line. What collect itself writes never rides — it is in the
commit it makes.
