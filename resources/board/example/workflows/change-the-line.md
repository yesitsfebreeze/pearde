# change-the-line — the fix, and the test that proves it

## Do

1. Write the test first. Run it: the test fails on the line as it stands.
2. Change the line. Run the test again: the test passes.
3. Run the file's whole test module and quote the count.

## Done when

- The new test fails before the change and passes after.
- The module's test count is quoted in the report.

## Fails when
