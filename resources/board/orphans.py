"""orphans — every done PRD whose footprint never reached the branch that
holds it.

    orphans [<board>…] [--board <path>] [--json]

A board may be its own git worktree of the code repo's store — `.pearde` on
branch `pearde`, the code on `main`, one object store between them. `git log
--all` from either worktree sees every branch of that store, so "which repo
holds sha X" is a question that cannot fail. The check that can is per branch:
a footprint path must have a commit on the branch its worktree actually checks
out. A path a misdirected commit put on the board branch and never on the code
branch is what this scan is for.

Classes, per footprint path of a done PRD:

    ok             a commit on the branch that holds it
    branch-only    a commit on the OTHER worktree's branch, never its own —
                   a misdirected commit's residue, for a person to re-commit
    nowhere        no commit on either branch, the file on disk — uncommitted
    absent         no commit, not on disk — a stale footprint spelling

Boards: the ones named on the line, else the board the call is on and its
members — there is no machine-wide list of boards to fall back to, and every
path this tool touches is relative to a `.pearde/`. A PRD's `repo:` key names
its own code
repo and wins over the board's — collect's `repo_of()` honours it the same
way. Exit 0 when the scan ran and no path is `branch-only`, 1 when any is.

Reads only. It commits nothing and writes nothing outside stdout — a person
does the re-commits the list names.

Cost: two `git log` calls per footprint path of a done PRD; no `--all`, no
index rebuild.
