# ── board ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# The board is one directory at a project root, under `.obsidian/`'s vault —
# it holds `prds/`, `memos/`, `wiki/` and `workflows/`, so a reader can see
# what the tool keeps without being told. `.state/` inside it is the
# machine-local corner: the plan, the two journals, the pass file and the
# rendered view, none of them committed, all of them regenerable.
#
# The name has no dot. It carried one until 2026-09-02, and that one character
# decided what a person could see: Obsidian skips every path holding a
# dot-segment before a setting is read, so from a vault at the project root the
# whole board was invisible, and the vault had to root at the board instead —
# which hid the project from the board. A symlink out of the hidden name is no
# way round it either; Obsidian refuses a symlink that resolves back inside the
# vault (@references/obsidian.md reads both mechanisms out of the app itself).
# So the board is `pearde/`, the vault is the project, and everything shows.
#
# `.pearde` survives as the legacy name: `board_at` still finds a board that
# never migrated, and `pearde upgrade` moves one and leaves a `.pearde`
# symlink behind, so every path spelled the old way keeps resolving.

      one exception is a cross-board need whose board is not in this
