"""pearde gantt — the plan as distance to the vision, not as a calendar.

One self-contained HTML file: `plan.py gantt` writes it to `prds/.view.html`
from the schedule `plan` saved in `.plan.json`, and the live service
serves the same render at `/board/<name>`.

**Why the x axis is not time.** The workers are agents. They start when the
work is dispatchable and there are as many of them as the board can usefully
run, so a calendar date on a bar is a guess about staffing, not a fact about
the plan. What is a fact is the dependency structure: how much work has to
finish, in sequence, before the vision is reached. That is the axis — weight
along the critical path, zero at *now*, and the right edge is the vision.

Read off it directly:

  · **critical** bars are the ones that set the finish. Shorten one and the
    vision moves left; shorten anything else and nothing happens
  · **float** is drawn as a tail: how late a task may start before it becomes
    critical. A long tail is slack you can spend
  · **ready now** is the frontier at x=0 — everything dispatchable this second,
    ordered by how much work each one unblocks. That ordering IS the dispatch
    order for the fastest path to the vision
  · a **footprint clash** is a pairwise `after` edge — the two PRDs are
    serialized, and nothing else waits with them. No rounds, no barriers

`dates` mode is one click away for a human who wants a calendar — it draws
the same bars on the worker-limited schedule `plan` computed.

The critical-path arithmetic happens here, in Python (`cpm`), so the numbers
the page draws and the numbers an agent reads out of it are the same numbers.
plan.py builds the payload — it owns the scan, the map and the settings. This
module enriches it, renders it and writes it.

def cpm(tasks):
    """Critical-path method over the plan's dependency graph, in weight.

    Forward pass with no worker limit — the question is not "when will three
    workers get to it" but "how soon could this possibly be reached", which
    is the only bound agents cannot argue with. Backward pass from the finish
    gives every task its float. Returns (tasks, meta). Tasks gain:

        es ef      earliest start / finish, weight from now
        ls lf      latest start / finish that still hits the finish
        slack      ls - es. 0 means critical
        critical   on a longest chain
        ready      dispatchable now — starts at zero, no dependency and no
                   footprint edge in front of it, and nobody already holding it
        unblocks   weight of work waiting downstream, transitively. The
                   frontier sorts by this: it is the size of the door the
                   task opens
        downstream how many PRDs that weight spans

    A `needs` naming a PRD outside the plan (done, parked, never scheduled) is
    already satisfied and drops out — `plan` resolved it, the graph only holds
    what is left to do.

    `after` is the plan's footprint serialization — two PRDs touching one
    path, ordered pairwise so two agents never edit one file together. It is
    an edge like any dependency, and ONLY an edge: the pair is ordered, and
    nothing else on the board waits with it — agents start the moment their
    own gates clear, so a round barrier would hold every PRD in the round for
    its slowest member.

    The track does not start at now. Tasks with `past: true` are done work,
    laid out by the same dependency arithmetic and shifted so the last of
    them ENDS at zero — the axis runs from the first landed PRD to the
    vision, and now is a place on it. Tasks with `parked: true` (failed,
    deferred, the user's own states) sit at zero with no float and no
    downstream: visible, weighed, and scheduled by nothing."""

#       green   finished and only waiting to be taken: every acceptance box
#               closed while a worker still holds it, or a lane main has not
#               seen. The act wanted is to close it, not to work it

#   · they rank when they collide: red over green over purple. A wall with
#     every box closed is still a wall; a finished PRD is worth taking before
#     it is worth knowing who holds it

#     Progress below `claimed` stays a ramp of ink weight; a hue is never
#     spent on ranking, on categories, or on decoration
