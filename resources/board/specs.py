"""pearde specs — the two transitions a spec set decides.

    specs.py specced <prd> [--blast high|mid|low] [--workflow <slug>] [--route -] [--check] [--dry]
    specs.py refine  <prd> [--dry] < report

`specced` reads every `specs/*.md`, refuses naming file and line, refuses a
set over `split-above` or `specs-above` (`over split-above: 58 > 40 — REFINE
it`; the two keys of `settings.md`, the PRD's own board's), else writes
`complexity:` as the sum, `blast-radius:` and `workflow:` from the flags,
clears `claim:`, sets `specced` and prints the progress line. With no
`--workflow` named and none on the PRD, one distinct `workflow:` across the
specs is written up onto the PRD instead of being read and dropped — specs
naming two different slugs write none, and the operator is told which on
stderr. `--check` runs
the gate and writes nothing. `--workflow <new-slug> --route -` drafts a
workflow the library does not hold from `## Route` on stdin — the file per
step and every new atomic's, `workflow check` over the whole library before
either is kept, refused whole on red with nothing written. `--workflow
<slug>` naming one the library already has refuses `--route` — the route
exists, follow it — and `--workflow none` is refused outright, naming
`## Route`. `refine` reads the `## Split` table off stdin,
writes one child `prd.md` per row from the template, the same table under the
parent's `## Children`, and sets the parent `open`.

Both take `--board <path>` (default: walk up from the cwd) and `--as <id>`,
the persona on the progress line, else `PEARDE_AS` from the environment —
the same rule as every transition, because the line is the only record of it.
The flags are declared in `FLAGS` and parsed by transitions.py `Args` — an
undeclared one is refused with the list, exit 2, before the board is read;
`--dry` prints the line the write would print, `dry ·` in front, and the
paths, and writes nothing.

Two warnings, never refusals, because a wide footprint can be legitimate: a
footprint entry that is a directory holding more than `footprint-above`
tracked files (the third key of `settings.md`, default 40, counted by `git
ls-files` in the PRD's repo) prints `<spec>: wide footprint — <path> holds <N>
tracked files …`, since a directory root clashes with every PRD on the board
and serializes each behind this one. A `## Split` table of three or more
children whose `needs` form one chain — the longest chain covers every child,
so nothing in the split runs at once — prints `chain: <N> children in one
line …` on stderr before `refine` writes anything, dry or real.

`plan.py` does the reading, `edit.py` the writing, and `transitions.py` prints
the progress line and records the row in `.transitions.jsonl` — the same
three every other transition goes through. The model creates no directory
and sums no number.

Python 3 stdlib only.

# ── can a verify block fail? ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

# collect runs every `## Verify and Proof` block under `bash -e -o pipefail`
# with the code repo as cwd, and reads the exit code that comes out. Between
# those two rules the block goes red only when something makes the script's
# exit non-zero: a failing command aborts the script when it is the LAST
# element of its and-or list — any earlier element merely shapes the flow,
# `set -e` exempts it, and the list's own non-zero result is carried on
# without an abort — and where nothing aborts, the block's exit is its
# final statement's status. So a block cannot fail iff no statement can
# abort and the last one can only end 0: every fallible command sits behind
# an always-0 fallback (`|| true`), an inversion (`!`), or a condition, and
# the block ends on an `echo`. collect reads exactly that exit, so a box
# carried by such a block is not a check — the shape the runner surfaced
# four times today. `specced` refuses it.

# Builtin commands whose exit status is 0 come what may. Anything not listed
# counts as able to exit non-zero — over-counting only ever accepts a block;
# under-counting would refuse a live one.
