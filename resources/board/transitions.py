"""pearde transitions — the orchestrator chooses, the tool moves the state.

    transitions.py add <title> [--priority N] [--body -] [--parent <prd>]
    transitions.py claim <prd> <worker>
    transitions.py release <prd> <state>
    transitions.py answer <prd> Q<n> "<text>"
    transitions.py defer <prd>
    transitions.py retry <prd>
    transitions.py unblock <prd>
    transitions.py set <prd> <state> [--force] [--worker <worker>]
    transitions.py sweep [--apply]

Every command: `--board <path>` names the board (default: walk up from the
cwd). `--as <id>` is the persona on the progress line, else `PEARDE_AS` from
the environment, else the command refuses — the line is the only record of
the persona, and a default would rewrite it. `add` is the one exception: a
new PRD has no earlier line to rewrite, so with neither it files the PRD
`· as engineer (default)` and says so on the line.

Every command declares the flags it takes in `FLAGS`, and `Args` is the one
parser — here, and in specs.py, collect.py, brief.py and init.py, which
import it. A flag not declared is refused before any read of the board:
`unknown flag --dyr — release takes: --as, --board, --dry`, exit 2, nothing
written. `--dry` on every command that writes prints the line the real run
would print, prefixed `dry ·`, then `would write:` with every path, and
writes nothing. `pearde <cmd> --help` prints the same list off the same
declaration.

Every command checks the gate @references/parts/states.md names, writes
through edit.py — one frontmatter line at a time, atomically — prints the
progress line of @references/parts/progress.md with every term computed here,
appends `{"t","prd","from","to"}` to `prds/.transitions.jsonl` — never to
`.history.jsonl`, the daemon's burn-down — and exits 1 with the gate named
when refused, writing nothing.

`claim` also records the claim's baseline — `prds/.claims/<prd>/`, through
collect.py `snapshot()` — and `answer` lists the `prd.md` it wrote in
`prds/.claims/riders`, through `owe()`: board state written between
transitions rides the next collect. A line printed from a shell ends
`pass file owed`: the pass file is rewritten at every transition, and
no hook sees a command.

`sweep` lists every held claim `plan.py` `silent_of` calls silent — no
file of the PRD's has moved for `claim-ttl` — and `--apply` moves
`analyzing → open` and `claimed → failed`, never one `prds/.pass.md`
names, never an analyst whose specs are on disk.

`COMMANDS` is what the dispatcher discovers. Each entry takes the argument
list after the command name and returns the exit code.
