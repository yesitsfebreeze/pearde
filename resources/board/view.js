   attached, or the two double up. The signal below is per instance: the new
   import aborts the old one's signal first, which cancels every listener the
   old copy registered through it. `window.__pearde_ivs` is the same registry
   for the clock loops. Custom elements cannot be redefined — the browser
   keeps the first class and its template until a real reload — so the copies
   that came after only ever mount the DOM, and a template made stale by a
   view change waits for the page to be reloaded to catch up. */

   The pitch is pinned, so a long board shows the rows that fit and holds the
   rest below the fold. Rather than charge a second gesture for them, the
   column reads as one full-height list: where the pointer sits down the
   column is where the list sits, top to bottom, and one pass down the column
   runs the whole board past the eye.

   Two things make it clickable rather than slippery. The list tracks only
   while the pointer is actually moving, so it is still under the hand the
   moment the hand stops — and the tooltip waits for that stop, which is how
   settling reads as an event rather than an absence. And arriving at the
   column glides rather than jumps, because a list that teleports under the
   cursor is a list nobody reaches into twice.

   Off entirely under reduced motion: this is a large involuntary movement,
   and the wheel, the drag, the arrows and the filter all still reach every

/* ── the field follows the hand ───────────────────────────────────────────
   A name says what the work is; it does not say where the work sits. So
   hovering a name brings that PRD's bar into the field, and running down the
   column brings each one in turn — the whole list read against the axis
   without spending a click.

   The rule that keeps this from swimming is that it moves as LITTLE as it
   can. A bar already in the window does not move the field at all, so a pan
   is never noise: it always means "this one is outside what you were
   looking at". When it must move it scrolls by the least that shows the bar,
   and when the bar is wider than the field it shows the START, because where
   the work begins is the question a name is being asked.

   It is a preview, so it is undone — the field returns to where it stood when
   the hand entered the column. Leaving restores, clicking commits: a click
   already pans on purpose through `focusTask`, and that one is meant to stick.

   Nothing is rebuilt while a preview is up. The tree opens and shuts branches
   by what is in the window, and a window the hand is only borrowing must not
   reflow the list the hand is moving down.                                  */

/* ── ⌘K — search everything ───────────────────────────────────────────────
   One search over the board, listed best first. ⌘K (or ctrl-K, or shift-K)
   opens the overlay from anywhere — including out of another input, which is
   the whole point of a command palette; typing queries `/search` on the
   daemon, which walks prds, specs, memos, wiki, workflows, the report and
   the settings.

   Three ways to match, one box: `re:<pat>` or `/<pat>` greps by regular
   expression, anything else is a literal substring plus a fuzzy pass over
   file names. The daemon ranks and the page renders in the order it gets —
   there is no second opinion here about what a good hit is.

   Enter jumps by the hit's kind: a prd or spec opens the inspector, a memo
   opens the memos view on that decision, anything the vault also holds opens
   in Obsidian, which is where those files are read. Light DOM, styled from
