# One part per line: `ok`, `off` (installed nowhere, nothing to repair), or
# `broken` (installed and not working — the failure that otherwise runs
# straight past). A broken part carries its exact fix on the next line.
# `skills`, `index`, `statusline`, `board` and `briefs` always report.
# `plugins` reports when an adapter carries a `plugins:` list — suggestions
# for the machine, never a failure.
# `memos`, `workflows`, `grammar`, `health`, `view` and `plan` need a board in scope, `origin`
# needs PRDs in it, and `members` only exists on a master board.
#
# No agent is named in this script and none is looked for. Where a skill goes
# and where a status line is configured are things only the reader knows —
# @references/install.md is the explanation, and it is written to be worked
# out rather than executed. What doctor checks is everything that is true
# regardless: the skill files are well-formed and every command name under
# resources/board/ is claimed by one module, the map matches the tree, the
# status line renders, and the board is on its contract.
#
# `--fix` repairs one thing and only one: a view service that is down or not
# watching this board. Nothing else here is unambiguous enough to repair
# unasked — a status line lives in a settings file that is the user's, and
# which index row a new file belongs in is a judgement. After repairing,
# doctor re-checks itself once, so the report and the exit code describe the
# state the repairs left behind.

# project with a vault directory but no entry in that register does not fail
# loudly: the URI opens the nearest registered ancestor instead — the parent
# folder holding every project, on a machine where that is a vault too — and
# the person sees a tree that is not this one. That is the failure this row is
# here to name. No vault directory at all is `off`, not broken: a board is a
# board without Obsidian. The row before those: a board still called
# `.pearde/`, which no vault can show at all (@references/obsidian.md).
# The register lives under the user's home, and a shell can export no HOME
# variable at all — `env -i`, a launchd job, a container, and every harness
# that runs doctor under a scrubbed environment. Under `set -u` a bare $HOME
# does not fail this row, it aborts the script: every row below here stops
# printing. So the read is guarded — and a shell that exports no HOME almost
# always still HAS a home: the uid resolves to one in the passwd database,
# which is exactly how the `plugins` row above already reads it
# (expanduser/getpwuid). Resolving it here too is what keeps one answer per
# run: an unregistered board reads `broken` whether or not the caller
# scrubbed the environment. Reading only the variable would let `env -i` turn
# the very failure this row exists to name into `ok`.
# The resolution is done with shell builtins FIRST, and no subprocess: bash
# expands `~` out of the passwd database with no PATH and no interpreter, and
# the environments this row exists for — `env -i`, launchd, a container — are
# precisely the ones with a thin PATH where `python3` may be absent (on macOS
# `/usr/bin/python3` is a stub that exits non-zero without the Command Line
# Tools). Resolving through `python3` first turned a true `broken` into `ok`
# on any such box. `unset HOME` inside the subshell is load-bearing, not
# decorative: `~` follows HOME when HOME is set-but-empty, which is one of
# the two cases that gets here. `python3`/getpwuid stays only as a second
# fallback. If neither resolves a home, the arm below reports what it can
# actually check — that the home could not be resolved — and reports it as

# ── harnesses: the board's own acceptance checks, actually run ───────────────
# Every PRD is closed against its own verify.sh, and until this row existed
# nothing ran one: `grep -rn verify.sh resources/ .claude` returned nothing,
# there is no CI and no hook, and every green total on record was a person
# remembering to type the command. So doctor runs them.
#
# The expected count is the harness's own and is never recorded here. A
# harness that pins its denominator — `[ "$((PASS+FAIL))" = 39 ] || no ...` —
# fails loudly when a check is dropped; one that does not prints a smaller
# total and exits 0, which is indistinguishable from success. So a harness
# that does not pin one is reported as unpinned rather than trusted, and its
# pass does not make this row green on its own account. A recorded expected
# total would be a second copy of a number the file already carries, and this
# board has twice paid for that shape.
#
# Opt-in, because it is slow: the row is the only one here measured in tens of
# seconds, and doctor is run to answer "is this wired up" in a second.

    # The cap. Unbounded parallelism made this row's failures untrustworthy:
    # in the sweep of 2026-09-01 nearly half the reds were contention, not
    # faults — harnesses that bind fixed ports (8477-8479) or spawn a board
    # service collide when forty-eight start at once, and a red that a serial
    # re-run turns green is not evidence of anything. So the sweep runs a few
    # at a time. HCAP=4: above the number of harnesses that actually contend
    # for a port or a service at any moment, and far enough below the box's
    # core count that no harness is starved of CPU while it waits on a socket
    # with a timeout. Raising it trades trust for wall-clock; lowering it buys
    # no more trust, only time. PEARDE_HCAP overrides it for an experiment.
