#!/bin/bash
# pearde install — build one skill folder per file in references/skills/.
#
#   install.sh <skills-dir>           say what it would make
#   install.sh --apply <skills-dir>   make it
#   install.sh --remove <skills-dir>  take it back out
#
# `<skills-dir>` is wherever your agent discovers skills. This script does not
# guess it and knows no agent by name — @references/install.md is the whole
# explanation, and working out the directory is step one of it.
#
# A skill is a folder because a skill file says `Read @README.md`, relative to
# its own folder. Five links per skill and every `@<path>` in the repo
# resolves through the install exactly as it does here:
#
#   <skills-dir>/<name>/SKILL.md -> references/skills/<name>.md
#                       README.md · index.md · references · resources
#
# Two Obsidian plugins the knowledge vault needs are fetched here rather than
# vendored — pinned versions, downloaded into resources/board/obsidian/plugins/
# where `pearde init` copies them into each board's vault.
#
# Links, never copies — one source of truth. A real file or directory already
# sitting where a link goes is reported and never replaced: it may hold your
# edits.
#
# One case is different. When this repo is itself sitting in <skills-dir>
# under the name of one of its skills, that slot is taken and no folder is
# built over it — the repo *is* that skill. Its @SKILL.md is the installer,
# and its job is done the moment the siblings exist, so --apply replaces it
# with a link to the skill file it stands in for. The installer gives way, the
# skill it shadows goes live, and there is one `pearde` rather than two.
# `git checkout SKILL.md` brings the installer back if you want to re-run it.
