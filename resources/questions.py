"""pearde questions — the round a PRD puts to the user, checked.

    python3 questions.py check [board]   one problem per line; silent when clean
    python3 questions.py list  [board]   prd · open · answered · state

A question round is `## Questions` in a `prd.md`, in the format
@references/drill.md sets: each question is the fork, ending in `?`, with
prepared answers, one of them recommended. `## Answers` is what the
orchestrator writes back. @references/templates/prd.md ships both headings
commented, and this file is what keeps the comment honest.

Why it exists, measured rather than argued. Across two boards on 2026-08-27:
ten PRDs carried `## Questions` and `## Answers` as bare headings with nothing
under them — a heading that says a round exists when none does; one carried
`## Answers` holding a reader's two remarks and no answer, under a PRD with no
`## Questions` at all; one sat parked on the user for three sessions without
ever writing down what it was asking; and one carried a whole sentence in
`needs:`, which `plan` resolves to nothing and reports nowhere. Every one of
them reads, from the outside, exactly like a board that is waiting on you.

The two rules that judge a written question are the two the format is for: it
asks something, and it comes with an answer you can pick. Option *count* is
deliberately not checked — a yes/no fork with a recommendation is a good
question, and a checker that demanded three would have failed six real ones.
