#
# Every term on line 2 is defined in @references/parts/progress.md. `⊞b` is the
# board count, on a master board only — the board plus its members.
#
# The board owns line 2 — sharing a row with the path pushes it off a narrow
# terminal. No board, no second line.
#
# `*N` is what `git status` reports — an untracked directory counts once, not
# per file inside it. `↑N`/`↓N` are commits against the upstream. No upstream
# says so: `↑0` would read as "everything is pushed" when there is nowhere to
# push to. `▸board` is an OSC-8 link to the board's view at
# 127.0.0.1:8443/board/<name>, matched on the daemon's registered path, and
# absent when no daemon is running. `▸vault` — beside it — opens the board in
# Obsidian (a native obsidian:// URI, no daemon) and renders whenever the
# project carries a vault at `<project>/.obsidian/`. PRD_STATUS_LINK=off renders
# the label without the escape, for a terminal that shows them raw.
#
# It reads four frontmatter keys — `state`, `complexity`, `origin`, and `est`
# as the weight's last fallback — and matches them
# by name at any indentation. Nested under a parent map reads the same as top
# level. Every other key is a user extension: never anchor these patterns to
# column 0.
#
# Reads the status JSON on stdin, or $PRD_STATUS_JSON when composed. Three
# fields are used: `current_dir` (or `cwd`) locates the board, `display_name`
# is the model, and `transcript_path` is where `<persona>` comes from — the
# only session state on this line, and the only one not read from a file the
# board owns.

# This script's own directory — resources/. The vault lookup below runs a
# sibling module out of it, and `DIR` further down is the *project*, from
# the status JSON, so it cannot serve.

# ── board segment — its own line ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A board is a `pearde/` directory holding settings.md (tooling's find_board)
# — `.pearde/` on a board that never migrated out of the hidden name, read
# through the compatibility symlink so the name shown is the board's own — or
# a directory called something else entirely carrying settings.md, which is
# how a project whose folder tree already uses the word `pearde` names its
# board (@resources/board/plan.py `named_boards`) — or, one board predating
# all three, a `prds/` dir carrying its own settings.md. Walking up, the board
# dir wins over prds/: a repo can hold both during a migration.
# Two passes over the same climb, the known names before the scan, so a board
# under a known name wins at any depth over a discovered one nearer the cwd —
# this repo ships `resources/board/example/`, which IS a board and is meant to
# be. `dirname`'s fixpoint is not always `/` — on a Windows drive path it is
# `C:` — so each loop guards its own exit; a no-op on POSIX.
