Archived out of the code repo's scout tree, which now ships tool files only.
This is scout's index two — the findings index. The five quality-gate configs
and the two dated star snapshots it refers to came with it and are in
`attachments/` beside this note.

# The findings — what won, on which axis, and when

The second index. `routes.md` says where a number comes from; the rows below
say what the numbers decided. One row per **job**, never per tool — "recursive
search over a source tree" is a job, "ripgrep" is an answer, and the job
outlives the answer.

What a finding is:

- **A job phrased as a choice.** If nothing was rejected, nothing was decided.
- **At least two axes.** Attention, installs, stars, hygiene — a pick standing
  on one route is an opinion and is marked `weak`.
- **Numbers, with the route that produced them.** `route.sh <id> <query>`
  reproduces every cell in the evidence tables below.
- **A date.** Findings expire: six months, then re-measure or delete. A stale
  row reads as current.
- **What would overturn it.** A finding that nothing could reverse was never a
  measurement.

Anything that has no answer yet goes to [Open](#open) — a queue, not a gap.

## Findings

### recursive search over a source tree

**Pick** `ripgrep`. **Beats** `the_silver_searcher`, `ugrep`, `grep`.

| tool | brew 30d | arch % | popcon inst | distros | scorecard |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ripgrep | 85,537 (#50) | 78.63 | 13,329 | 122 | 4.7 |
| fd | 13,376 (#300) | 47.09 | 5,486 | — | 6.8 |
| ugrep | 4,899 (#567) | 1.84 | 655 | 91 | — |
| the_silver_searcher | 752 (#1441) | 4.37 | 2,255 | 108 | 3.4 |

**Why** the four axes agree, which is the whole test — ripgrep leads on
installs (`brew`), on early-adopter machines (`arch`), on conservative ones
(`popcon`), and on packaging breadth (`repology`). `the_silver_searcher` holds
distro breadth from its 2014 peak and nothing else; the gap between its 108
distros and its 752 monthly installs is what an abandoned tool looks like from
outside. `fd` is in the table as the control — a different job (find files, not
search contents) and it ranks second everywhere, which is how you know the
axes are measuring adoption and not fashion.

**Overturned by** ripgrep's `scorecard` at 4.7 being the weakest cell here; a
`depsdev` gap of a year, or an `osv` advisory, moves this to `ugrep`, which is
the only entrant with comparable distro coverage and an active maintainer.

**Route gotcha** `repology fd` returns 0 — the project is `fd-find` there. A
zero from repology reports a wrong name far more often than an unpackaged
tool.

### web search from a script, no API key

**Pick** `marginalia` for the non-commercial web, `ddg` as the mainstream
fallback, your own SearXNG when volume matters. **Beats** every public SearXNG
instance, Brave, Exa, Tavily, grep.app, Sourcegraph.

| endpoint | result |
|---|---|
| `api.marginalia.nu/public/search/<q>` | 200, JSON, no key, CC-BY-NC-SA |
| `lite.duckduckgo.com/lite/` | 200, HTML — 10 result links parsed |
| 8 public SearXNG instances from `searx.space` | `429`, or HTML in answer to `format=json` |
| Brave · Exa · Tavily | key and billing |
| `grep.app/api/search` | `429` on the first anonymous call |
| `sourcegraph.com/.api/search/stream` | 200, `matchCount: 0` — public code search needs a token |

**Why** the free tier of web search has closed almost completely, leaving one
deliberately non-commercial index and one HTML endpoint tolerating a scraper.
Both are fine at a handful of queries an hour and neither survives a loop.
Volume means running SearXNG yourself — a container and a one-line settings
change.

**Overturned by** a public instance answering `format=json` twice in a week —
re-run the `searx.space` filter before assuming the tier stayed closed.

### star momentum for a repo we do not own

**Pick** our own snapshots — `scout.sh sweep` daily, `scout.sh delta` to read
them. **Beats** the stargazers API, star-history, OSS Insight.

| source | result |
|---|---|
| `api.github.com/repos/*/stargazers` | restricted since 2026-06-30 for repos you do not own |
| `api.star-history.com` | 200, but renders an SVG chart — a picture, not a series |
| `api.ossinsight.io/v1/trends/repos/` | 200, engagement score fusing stars, forks, PRs, pushes |
| `snapshots/*.tsv` + `scout.sh delta` | a real series, from the day we started taking one |

**Why** every hosted timeline for a repo we do not own is gone or is a
rendering. The only series that exists is the one we accumulate, which costs
one search call per bucket per day and answers immediately about anything in
`buckets.txt` — and nothing about the rest. OSS Insight fills exactly that
hole as a discovery channel for repos we never bucketed, with a tail of 30-star
projects, so the output reads as a candidate list and never as a ranking.

**Overturned by** GitHub restoring the stargazers timeline, which would make
the snapshot directory redundant for anything we did not already sample.

### a page as text an agent can hold

**Pick** `r.jina.ai`. **Beats** nothing yet — one axis, so this is `weak`.

| endpoint | result |
|---|---|
| `r.jina.ai/<url>` | 200, markdown with title and published date, no key at low volume |

**Why** `r.jina.ai` is the only extractor measured, and worked on the first
call without a key — a reason to use the tool today and not a finding.

**Overturned by** the first head-to-head against a local extractor
(`trafilatura`, `readability`) on a page with a paywall, a cookie wall and a
JS-rendered body — recorded in [Open](#open) as the next measurement.

### one widget API → terminal + web + native desktop

**Pick** no framework ships all three, actively, from one widget tree. Nearest
matches: `ratatui` + `ratzilla` (Rust) for a terminal-first stack, `Textual` +
`textual-web`/`textual-serve` (Python) for a Python one — both give one widget
tree for terminal and browser, and both call "the app on Windows/Linux/macOS"
the same cross-compiled terminal binary run natively per OS, not a windowed
GUI. **Beats** `Dioxus`, `Iced`, `egui`/`eframe`, `Slint`, `Flutter`, Ink+React
Native.

| candidate | terminal | web | native desktop (windowed) | gh ★ | downloads | last push | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dioxus | dropped | yes (WASM) | yes (webview, `dioxus-desktop`) | 38,898 | 2.45M (870k/90d) | 0d ago | `dioxus-tui`/`rink` last published 2024-02-23 at 0.5.0-alpha while core is at 0.8.0-alpha (2026-07-30); `packages/tui` is gone from the monorepo — the platform was *removed*, not gated |
| ratatui + ratzilla | yes | yes (WASM/canvas) | terminal binary only | 22,415 / 1,433 | 46.6M / 408k | 0d ago / 54d ago | same `Widget` trait renders to both; ratzilla is young (2024) but active |
| Textual + textual-web | yes | yes (websocket frame-diff, zero code changes) | terminal binary only | 37,067 | 66.2M (pypi, wk) | 47d ago | strongest same-code terminal→browser story found; no native-desktop renderer |
| Iced | no | limited (`iced_web`, unmaintained) | yes (native) | 31,375 | 2.60M | 0d ago | no terminal backend |
| egui/eframe | no | yes (WASM) | yes (native) | 30,193 | 22.3M | 0d ago | no terminal backend |
| Slint | no | yes (WASM) | yes (native + embedded) | 23,609 | 1.55M | 0d ago | no terminal backend |

**Why** the job as phrased — one widget, three real surfaces, with per-platform
guards for what a plugin can't do everywhere — has a single close-to-exact
answer (Dioxus) that turns out to have quietly dropped the terminal leg: the
last `dioxus-tui` release predates the current 0.8.0-alpha core by two and a
half years, and the crate isn't in the current monorepo at all — a materially
different failure than a *guarded* platform gap, because the API was deleted
rather than kept and gated per target. Every remaining framework with a
real native (windowed) desktop renderer (Iced, egui, Slint, Flutter) has no
terminal target at all, and every framework with a genuine same-code
terminal→browser story (ratatui+ratzilla, Textual+textual-web) has no
windowed-desktop renderer — "the app for Windows/Linux/macOS" in both is the
terminal binary itself, which is a legitimate cross-platform native
application, just not a GUI window. Feature-gating per platform (the part of
the ask about guards) is native to both survivors: Rust's `#[cfg(...)]` on the
web target for the ratatui stack, and Textual's own `is_web`/driver
capability checks for the Python one — neither needed inventing.

**Overturned by** `dioxus-tui`/`rink` shipping a release against the current
0.8 core (revives the one framework with a real windowed-desktop renderer),
or a new project entering the `gh` sweep claiming all three surfaces from one
widget tree — none found in this pass.

### train and run a small model inside a Rust harness

**Pick** `candle`. **Beats** `ort`, `tch`, `burn`, `mistral.rs`,
`llama-cpp-2`. Confirms the choice `model` already made rather than changing
it — the point of measuring was that it had never been measured.

| runtime | crates recent | crates all-time | gh ★ | last push | open issues | scorecard | osv |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ort` (ONNX Runtime) | 6,417,581 | 16,840,565 | 2,477 | 0d | 2 | — | clean |
| `candle-core` | 2,607,833 | 7,417,363 | 20,964 | 4d | 890 | — | clean |
| `tch` (libtorch) | 1,552,628 | 6,737,595 | 5,480 | 4d | 248 | 3.2 | clean |
| `llama-cpp-2` | 583,877 | 1,144,115 | 639 | 0d | 51 | — | clean |
| `burn-core` | 385,958 | 1,290,008 | 15,826 | 0d | 302 | — | clean |
| `mistralrs-core` | 151,600 | 199,746 | 7,632 | 0d | 384 | — | clean |

**Why** the axes disagree loudly, and the disagreement is the finding. `ort`
leads installs by 2.5× over `candle` on an eighth of the stars — the signature
of a library embedded inside other people's tools rather than built on
directly. `ort` is also **inference-only**: an ONNX Runtime wrapper cannot run
`apply_gradient`, which is half of this tree's `Node` trait, so its install
lead is measuring a job we are not doing. `tch` can train and has the deepest
all-time installs of the trainers, and loses on the thing the numbers do not
show: it links libtorch, which is a C++ toolchain and a multi-gigabyte artifact
inside a tree whose whole packaging discipline is a single Rust binary. `burn`
is the real rival — comparable stars, pushed daily, a genuinely better backend
story via CubeCL — and loses only on installs, 6.8× behind `candle`, which for
a framework you build *on* is the axis that matters. `mistral.rs` and
`llama-cpp-2` are serving runtimes for models someone else trained; they answer
a different job (see Open).

**Overturned by** the training half moving off-device, which deletes every
reason `candle` beat `ort`; or `burn` closing the install gap while holding its
cadence, at which point CubeCL's multi-backend story is the stronger position
and the only cost is a port.

**Route gotcha** `route.sh crates` is a *fuzzy* search ranked by downloads, so a
short query name is swamped by unrelated crates that outrank it — `tch`, `ort`,
`burn` and `tokenizers` each returned pages of noise before the crate itself.
Query a distinctive substring (`onnxruntime` finds `ort`; `burn-core` finds
`burn`) and read the description column to confirm identity. A "not found" from
this route usually means the query was too short.

**Hygiene axis is thin here and says so.** Five of the six have no OpenSSF
scorecard at all; only `tch` is in the dataset, at 3.2, with `Code-Review` and
`Token-Permissions` both 0. The gap is no evidence `candle` is safer — the
ML-in-Rust corner sits largely outside the hygiene ecosystem, and the
`deny.toml` gate carries that risk alone.

### community plugins to install alongside pearde

**Pick** `ponytail`, `claude-hud`, `planning-with-files`, `cc-safety-net`;
`caveman` already installed. **Beats** `claude-mem`, `claude-obsidian`,
`engram`, `recall` — all rejected as duplicates of pearde's own knowledge
layer, which is the whole point of this tree.

| plugin | stars | pushed | license | job |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DietrichGebert/ponytail | 117,852 | 2026-08-07 | MIT | lazy-senior-dev output discipline |
| JuliusBrussee/caveman | 101,970 | (installed) | — | token compression — already active on this machine |
| thedotmack/claude-mem | 92,716 | 2026-08-31 | Apache-2.0 | **rejected** — replaces the knowledge layer pearde already is |
| jarrodwatts/claude-hud | 27,742 | (active) | — | visibility: context usage, tools, agents |
| OthmanAdi/planning-with-files | 26,489 | 2026-08-31 | MIT | crash-proof markdown plans |
| kenryu42/cc-safety-net | 1,517 | (active) | — | pre-execution guard vs destructive git/fs commands |

**Why** stars came from two GitHub search buckets (`topic:claude-code-plugin`,
`topic:claude-plugin`, sorted by stars) plus targeted lookups; the state axes
(pushed date, license, archived) separate the live from the frozen — caveman's
own family (`cavekit`, `cavemem`) is frozen and says so in its README, which is
honest but disqualifying for a new install.

**Overturned by** any pick going archived/frozen, or by pearde shipping the
plugin's job natively (as it already did to `claude-mem`).

### scrub an animation to scroll position on the web

**Pick** native CSS scroll-driven animations (`animation-timeline: scroll()/view()`)
where browser support allows; `motion` (framer-motion) or GSAP ScrollTrigger with
`scrub` where JS logic is needed; `lenis` as the scroll-smoothing layer beneath
either. **Beats** the entire trigger-based reveal-on-scroll category.

| candidate | npm-dl /wk | gh stars | last push | state |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| framer-motion + motion | 45.7M + 20.0M | 33,438 | 1d | active, MIT |
| gsap | 4.8M | 28,156 | 140d | slow (post-Webflow cadence), custom licence |
| lenis | 1.3M | 15,643 | 4d | active, MIT |
| locomotive-scroll | 14.5k | — | — | superseded by lenis (same authors' niche) |
| lax.js | — | 10,474 | 468d | **ARCHIVED** |
| scrollreveal | — | 22,475 | 878d | stale |
| WOW | — | 9,899 | 799d | stale |

**Why** the axes agree twice over. On installs and state, everything active is
*scroll-linked* (position maps to timeline progress, reversible) and everything
*trigger-based* (fire once at a threshold) is archived or years stale — a whole
generation of libraries died when the model changed. On attention (`hn`),
the native CSS API is the rising entrant: scroll-driven-animations.style at 62
points, Addy Osmani and Josh Comeau writing it up in 2025. The category verdict
is the finding: the web moved from *triggered* to *scrubbed* scroll animation.

**Overturned by** the native API reaching universal support with off-main-thread
guarantees, which would demote the JS engines to logic-only roles; or `motion`'s
cadence collapsing after its split from Framer.

### several sessions on one repo, without N full checkouts

**Pick** keep `git worktree`; move every regenerable directory to one shared
path per machine and symlink it into each lane. **Beats** OpenZFS on macOS,
APFS `clonefile` cloning (`cp -Rc`, `rift`, `cow`, `claude-cow-worktree`,
`cowtree`), bindfs/unionfs-fuse overlays, and `git clone --shared`.

**The measurement that decides it** — this repo, 2026-09-02:

| what | number |
|---|---|
| files in the tree | 15,992 |
| files git tracks | 174 |
| tracked bytes | 2.1 MB |
| the tree on disk | 273 MB |
| files under 4 KB | 11,766 |
| a `git worktree` checkout | 2.1 MB |
| one lane on disk | 9-26 MB |
| `graphify/` dirs | 79 MB |
| `obsidian/` plugin bundles | 61 MB |

A worktree costs the tracked bytes and nothing else. 99% of what is on disk is
untracked and regenerable, and each of the 27 lanes regenerates its own copy:
graphify AST caches, Obsidian plugin bundles fetched per checkout, scout
snapshots. The worktree is not what eats the disk — the lane's own output is.

**Why copy-on-write does not fix it.** CoW shares blocks until one side writes
them. Every lane writes its *own* graphify cache — different bytes by
construction — so the divergence lands exactly where the disk goes, and a
clone pays full price for it. Measured on this repo, free-space delta with an
89 MB/3s noise floor: APFS clone of the whole tree ≈ 176 MB against a plain
copy at ≈ 809 MB. Real, and nothing like the "near-zero" the tools claim,
because a tree of 11,766 sub-4 KB files is metadata-bound: `clonefile` shares
extents and still allocates every inode and directory entry.

**Why not ZFS.** OpenZFS on macOS is real and shipping for Apple Silicon
(2.4.0, 2025-12-18), and a kernel extension: a reboot, reduced security on
Apple Silicon, panics on an unclean unmount, and a non-APFS volume holding the
one repo every session writes. It buys the same CoW that APFS already gives
for free via `clonefile`, against the eater that CoW does not address. `brew`
knows no `openzfs` formula — the install is the project's own package.

**The ready-mades, ranked** (gh stars · last push · state):

| tool | stars | state | is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `anomalyco/rift` | 1211 | active, 19d | worktree replacement on `clonefile`/reflink/btrfs. README: "experimental and is not ready for use" |
| `clawkwork/clawk` | 1003 | active, 19d | per-agent VMs; CoW is the disk layer, not the point |
| `palmin/claude-cow-worktree` | 14 | slow, 116d | Python, exactly this job |
| `joeinnes/cow` | 13 | slow, 166d | Rust, `clonefile` + symlinks `node_modules` |
| `windsornguyen/cowtree` | 12 | slow, 122d | Python |

The category exists and is immature. All of them call one syscall, and macOS
exposes it as `cp -Rc <src> <dst>` — 0.07 s on 23 MB here, already installed,
no dependency to adopt. Reach for the flag, not the wrapper.

**Rejected on their own axis.** `git clone --shared`/`--reference` shares the
object store, which is 11 MB here and already shared by worktrees; the
checkout is untouched. `bindfs` needs macFUSE (kext) or FUSE-T, calls its own
macOS support "best-effort", and reads 7 installs/30d on `brew` against 128
for the `bindfs-mac` tap — and a bind mount is not a writable overlay, which
is what a lane needs. macOS has no OverlayFS. `git` 2.55 has no reflink knob:
no `core.useReflinks`, nothing in `clone --help`.

**Overturned by** the tree changing shape. If the tracked checkout ever
outgrows the generated output — a vendored dependency, a binary asset — the
per-file metadata stops dominating and `cp -Rc` becomes the answer after all.
Re-measure the two columns before switching, never the total.

## Open

Jobs asked, not yet measured. A row leaves this table only as a finding above.

| job | axes to measure on | why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| local vs hosted markdown extraction | fidelity on paywall / cookie-wall / JS-rendered pages | the `read` route is a network dependency in every crawl |
| polite bulk fetching of a domain | crawl-delay compliance, resume, cache | `crawl` and `wayback` answer about the past, nothing fetches the present in bulk |
| embedding model for local retrieval | `models` downloads, licence, dimensions, RAM | `models` ranks by downloads, which is the weakest axis in this file |
| TUI framework, Rust | `gh` stars · `crates` recent downloads · `depsdev` cadence | picked once, lived with for years |
| MCP servers worth wiring in | `mcp` census · `gh` stars · `scorecard` | the registry is self-serve, so it is unfiltered by construction |
| give a general LLM knowledge of one tree it never saw | gap vs a general-model arm on a human-authored question set · retrieval baseline on the same set | the whole thesis of `model`'s support role; the RAG arm is the control it must beat, and it is currently unmeasured |
| structured vs unstructured model on a few-MB corpus | held-out accuracy at equal params and equal compute | `encode-the-bias-we-have` is decided on an argument, with no reading behind it |
| serving runtime for a small model beside a harness | `crates` recent-dl · `docker` pulls · startup latency · resident memory | a different job from training, and `mistral.rs` / `llama-cpp-2` were rejected above only for training, not for this |
| detecting that a trained model has gone stale against its source tree | corpus-hash drift · answer disagreement with current files | named as the killing risk in `the-support-model-knows-the-harness` and nothing measures it |

## Maintenance

- Write the finding when the measurement is made, not when the tool is
  adopted. The numbers are perishable and the reasoning is not.
- Re-run `route.sh check` before adding a row. A finding produced by a route
  that has since died is deleted with the route.
- Six months old is re-measured or deleted. There is no third option.
- A pick that changes gets its row rewritten in place, with the new date — the
  argument for the old pick lives in version control, never in this file.
